</div>

<p>In preparing this book the author has
sought to awaken a keener perception and
a higher appreciation of the artistic and
ethical value of story-telling; to simplify
some of its problems; to emphasize the true
delight which the story-teller may share with
her hearers; and to present fresh material
which answers to the test of being good in
substance as well as in literary form.</p>

<p>Grateful acknowledgment is made to Miss
Mabel Bartleson, children’s librarian, and to
Miss Ida May Ferguson, of the children’s
department of the Minneapolis Public
Library, for their thoughtful assistance, and
to the authors and publishers of copyrighted
stories included in this volume, for their generous
aid. Specific credit is given in
connection with each story.</p>

<span class="smaller">Story-Telling in the Home</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The home, the school, and the library
have each a distinct purpose in story-telling.
These purposes may be more or less
complex, they may in some instances coincide,
yet the fields are separate, and each
has its own fundamental reason for presenting
the oral story to the child.</p>

<p>In the home, the chief object in story-telling
is to give content, to satisfy. The
child, becoming tired of his toys or of his
games, comes to his mother and begs for a
story. He wants to be taken into her lap,
cuddled within her arms, and entertained.
Oh, the wonderful, the far-reaching opportunities
held by the mother in such moments
as these! The child is in a quiet, receptive
mood, and the stories told him at such times
will never be forgotten; their influence will
follow him as long as he lives. Nothing that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
he can learn in school in the after years will
abide and enter into the essence of his being
as will the stories which his mother tells him.
Strength of character, purity of life, truthfulness,
unselfishness, obedience, faith—all
may be made beautiful and attractive by
means of stories.</p>

<p>Nor is the directly ethical training the
greatest good achieved by story-telling in the
home. Nothing else so closely links mother
and child in a sweet fellowship and communion
of thought. Nothing else so intimately
binds them together, nor so fully
secures the confidence of the child. When they
enter together the enchanted realm of story-land,
mother and child are in a region apart,
a region from which others are excluded.
The companionship of story-land belongs only
to congenial souls. And so the mother, by
means of stories, becomes the intimate companion,
the loving and wise guide, the dearest
confidant of her child.</p>

<p>Not all the stories of the home need be
ethical in their teaching, though all stories
worth telling have a foundation of truth.
There should be a wise blending of fairy
stories, mythological tales, fables, nonsense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
verses, and true nature stories; and the
advantage of story-telling is that it may be
carried on in connection with many of the
household duties, with no diminishing of the
story’s charm. While the mother sews or
embroiders or mends, while she stirs a cake,
or washes dishes, she can tell a story which
will not only entertain or influence the child,
but will carry her own thoughts away from
the ofttimes dullness of her task into realms
of beauty and delight. Then, too, many a
childish task may be robbed of its seemingly
tedious character by the telling of a story
during its progress, or as a reward when
the task is completed.</p>

<p>Let me beg of you, mothers, do not think
that you cannot tell stories. Try; try; keep
on trying; and ease in telling is bound to
come. Do not think of yourself in the telling;
think of the story and of the child who
listens. Nothing else matters.</p>

<p>It takes time to search out and familiarize
oneself with just the stories that are best
worth telling, but surely no mother can find
a more important or more worthy object upon
which to expend the time. Librarians and
story-tellers within the past few years have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
prepared lists which make such selection,
comparatively easy, mid classified lists are
included in the present volume.</p>

<p>The very little child can grasp only the
simplest story, but the essential facts of any
story which he can comprehend, can be simply
told. A story for a little child should
have few characters, little if any plot, and a
familiarity of action or place. Mother Goose
and similar nursery rhymes naturally come
first for little children in the home. The
kindergarten collections of stories contain
good material, and these can be followed by
or interspersed with the simplest myths and
fairy tales.</p>

<p>Just as children love the companionship
of animals, so do they love stories of animals;
and when these animals do the things that
children do, an element of surprise and new
delight is added. Children intuitively want
the right to prevail. They love the old tales
wherein animals talk, and the crafty old fox
is always beaten by the good little hen.</p>

<p>Bible stories should be told to children day
by day. They can be made very simple in
outline, but they should be told over and over,
with a distinction made between them and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
the fables and folk tales. The latter may
teach a true lesson, but the former teach <i>The
Truth</i>. And not only should we tell the Old
Testament stories of heroes and of great
wonders, but the story of Christ’s birth, of
his life, his death, and his resurrection, should
be made a part of every child’s early teaching
in the form of stories reverently told.
They will make a lasting impression; an
impression deeper than the most eloquent
sermon heard in maturer years.</p>

<p>A careful choice of the kind of stories told
to little children lays not only a sound moral
foundation, but a foundation for good literary
taste.</p>

<p>A child brought up from its earliest years
on stories from the Bible, Anderson, Aesop,
Stevenson, and Field, will instinctively detect
and reject trash when he begins to read
for himself. But the supply of good literature
must be kept at hand, for children <i>will</i>
read <i>something</i>.</p>

<p>What sweeter bit of verse can a mother
repeat to the child she is hushing to sleep
than this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sleep, little pigeon, and fold your wings—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Little blue pigeon with velvet eyes;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sleep to the singing of motherbird swinging—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Swinging her nest where her little one lies.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In through the window a moonbeam comes—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Little gold moonbeam with misty wings;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All silently creeping, it asks: “Is he sleeping—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sleeping and dreaming while mother sings?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The stanzas are from “A Japanese Lullaby,”
and are selected from a host of similarly
dainty verses in <i>Lullaby Land</i>, by
Eugene Field (Charles Scribner’s Sons).</p>

<p>Robert Louis Stevenson’s <i>Child’s Garden
of Verse</i> is another storehouse of treasure
for mothers. Some of his rhymes, such as
“Good and Bad Children,” are quite equal
to Mother Goose in their good advice administered
in quaintly merry form, while his
“Foreign Lands” and “My Shadow” teach
children to idealize the everyday happenings
of the home life.</p>

<p>How could a mother better remind her
small boy or girl that it is time to waken
than by repeating his lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A birdie with a yellow bill</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Hopped upon the window-sill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cocked his shining eye and said:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“Ain’t you ’shamed, you sleepy-head!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When a mother habitually repeats to her
child stories and verses of the character outlined,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
she is not only forming his taste in
literature along right lines, but she is helping
to enlarge his vocabulary.</p>

<p>“What does ‘embark’ mean, Mamma?”
is sure to follow the first or second recital
of Stevenson’s “My Bed Is a Boat”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My bed is like a little boat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nurse helps me in when I embark;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She girds me in my sailor coat</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And starts me in the dark.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And “gird” will also need interpreting.
These words will soon become a part of his
normal vocabulary. He may not use them in
his everyday speech, but he will not need to
have them explained to him when he comes
upon them in his later reading. Teachers
invariably know when a child comes from a
home of culture and of good literary taste,
by the foundation already laid. The child’s
own forms of expression and the range of his
vocabulary are unmistakable evidence of the
home influence and teaching.</p>

<p>A literary sequence which will give the
child a knowledge of literature as a development
or a growth—not as a vast accumulation
of unrelated parts—can be carried
through his reading and study. This subject<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
is taken up in the chapter upon “Systematic
Story-Telling,” and while it is essentially the
work of a teacher, the foundation for it may
be laid by the wise mother who starts her
child along right lines through the medium of
her story-telling.</p>

<p>It has already been said that all stories
worth the telling have a foundation of truth.
The story with which this chapter closes is a
beautiful example of a nature story which
embodies a higher truth. It is found in Mrs.
Gatty’s <i>Parables from Nature</i> (The Macmillan
Company):</p>

<h4>A Lesson of Faith<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h4>

<p>A mild, green caterpillar was one day
strolling about on a cabbage leaf, when there
settled beside her a beautiful Butterfly.</p>

<p>The Butterfly fluttered her wings feebly,
and seemed very ill.</p>

<p>“I feel very strange and dizzy,” said the
Butterfly, addressing the Caterpillar, “and
I am sure that I have but a little while to
live. But I have just laid some butterfly
eggs on this cabbage leaf, and if I die there
will be no one to care for my baby butterflies.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
I must hire a nurse for them at once, but I
cannot go far to seek for one. May I hire you
as nurse, kind Caterpillar? I will pay you
with gold dust from my wings.”</p>

<p>Then, before the surprised Caterpillar
could reply, the Butterfly went on, “Of course
you must not feed them on the coarse cabbage
leaves which are your food. Young
butterflies must be fed upon early dew and
the honey of flowers. And at first, oh, good
Caterpillar, they must not be allowed to fly
far, for their wings will not be strong. It
is sad that you cannot fly yourself. But I
am sure you will be kind, and will do the
best you can.”</p>

<p>With that the poor Butterfly drooped her
wings and died, and the Caterpillar had no
chance to so much as say “Yes,” or “No.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” she exclaimed, as she looked
at the butterfly eggs beside her, “what sort
of a nurse will I make for a group of gay
young butterflies? Much attention they will
pay to the advice of a plain caterpillar like
me. But I shall have to do the best that I
can,” she added. And all that night she
walked around and around the butterfly eggs
to see that no harm came to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>“I wish that I had someone wiser than
myself to consult with,” she said to herself
next morning. “I might talk it over with
the house dog. But, no,” she added hastily,
“he is kind, but big and rough, and one brush
of his tail would whisk all the eggs off the
cabbage leaf.</p>

<p>“There is Tom Cat,” she went on, after
thinking a few moments, “but he is lazy and
selfish, and he would not give himself the
trouble to think about butterfly eggs.</p>

<p>“Ah, but there’s the Lark!” she exclaimed
at length. “He flies far up into the heavens
and perhaps he knows more than we creatures
that live upon the earth. I’ll ask him.”</p>

<p>So the Caterpillar sent a message to the
Lark, who lived in a neighboring cornfield,
and she told him all her troubles.</p>

<p>“And I want to know how I, a poor crawling
Caterpillar, am to feed and care for a
family of beautiful young butterflies. Could
you find out for me the next time you fly
away up into the blue heavens?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can,” said the Lark, and off
he flew.</p>

<p>Higher and higher he winged his way until
the poor, crawling Caterpillar could not even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
hear his song, to say nothing of seeing him.</p>

<p>After a very long time—at least it seemed
so to the Caterpillar, who, in her odd, lumbering
way, kept walking around and around
the butterfly eggs—the Lark came back.</p>

<p>First, she could hear his song away up
in the heavens. Then it sounded nearer and
nearer, till he alighted close beside her and
began to speak.</p>

<p>“I found out many wonderful things,”
he said. “But if I tell them to you, you will
not believe me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes I will,” answered the Caterpillar
hastily, “I believe everything I am told.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said the Lark, “the first
thing I found out was that the butterfly eggs
will turn into little green caterpillars, just
like yourself, and that they will eat cabbage
leaves just as you do.”</p>

<p>“Wretch!” exclaimed the Caterpillar,
bristling with indignation. “Why do you
come and mock me with such a story as that?
I thought you would be kind, and would try
to help me.”</p>

<p>“So I would,” answered the Lark, “but
I told you, you would not believe me,” and
with that he flew away to the cornfield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>“Dear me,” said the Caterpillar, sorrowfully.
“When the Lark flies so far up into
the heavens I should not think he would come
back to us poor creatures with such a silly
tale. And I needed help so badly.”</p>

<p>“I would help you if you would only
believe me,” said the Lark, flying down to
the cabbage patch once more. “I have wonderful
things to tell you, if you would only
have faith in me and trust in what I say.”</p>

<p>“And you are not making fun of me?”
asked the Caterpillar.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” answered the Lark.</p>

<p>“But you tell me such impossible things!”</p>

<p>“If you could fly with me and see the wonders
that I see, here on earth, and away up
in the blue sky, you would not say that <i>anything</i>
was <i>impossible</i>,” replied the Lark.</p>

<p>“But,” said the Caterpillar, “you tell me
that these eggs will hatch out into caterpillars,
and I <i>know</i> that their mother was a
butterfly, for I saw her with my own eyes;
and so of course they will be butterflies. How
could they be anything else? I am sure I can
reason that far, if I cannot fly.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered the Lark, “then I
must leave you, though I have even more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
wonderful things that I could tell. But what
comes to you from the heavens, you can only
receive by faith, as I do. You cannot crawl
around on your cabbage leaf and reason these
things out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do believe what I am told,” repeated
the Caterpillar—although she had
just proved that it was not true—“at least,”
she added, “everything that is <i>reasonable</i>
to believe. Pray tell me what else you
learned.”</p>

<p>“I learned,” said the Lark, impressively,
“that you will be a butterfly, yourself, some
day.”</p>

<p>“Now, indeed, you are making fun of me,”
exclaimed the Caterpillar, ready to cry with
vexation and disappointment. But just at
that moment she felt something brush against
her side, and, turning her head, she looked
in amazement at the cabbage leaf, for there,
just coming out of the butterfly eggs, were
eight or ten little green caterpillars—and
they were no more than out of the eggs before
they began eating the juicy leaf.</p>

<p>Oh, how astonished and how ashamed the
Caterpillar felt. What the Lark had said
was true!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>And then a very wonderful thought came
to the poor, green Caterpillar. “If this part
is true, it must all be true, and some day <i>I</i>
shall be a <i>butterfly</i>.”</p>

<p>She was so delighted that she began telling
all her caterpillar friends about it—but
they did not believe her any more than she
had believed the Lark.</p>

<p>“But I know, I <i>know</i>,” she kept saying to
herself. And she never tired of hearing the
Lark sing of the wonders of the earth below,
and of the heavens above.</p>

<p>And all the time, the little green caterpillars
on the leaf grew and thrived wonderfully,
and the big green Caterpillar watched
them and cared for them carefully every
hour.</p>

<p>One day the Caterpillar’s friends gathered
around her and said, very sorrowfully, “It
is time for you to spin your chrysalis and
die.”</p>

<p>But the Caterpillar replied, “You mean
that I shall soon be changed into a beautiful
butterfly. How wonderful it will be.”</p>

<p>And her friends looked at one another
sadly and said, “She is quite out of her
mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>Then the Caterpillar spun her chrysalis and
went to sleep.</p>

<p>And by and by, when she wakened, oh,
then she <i>knew</i> that what the Lark had learned
in the heavens was true—for she was a beautiful
butterfly, with gold dust on her wings.</p>

<span class="smaller">Why Tell Stories in School?</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Every lover of children knows that a
good story, well told, is a source of the
purest joy; but while this of itself is sufficient
reason for story-telling in the home and
in the nursery, it is not sufficient reason for
general story-telling in the school. Happiness
is a powerful ally of successful work, but
it never should be substituted for the work
itself; it may well be made one of the means
of attainment, but never the object to be
attained. Useful service is a far higher ideal
than personal happiness, and it should be the
ideal held before the child who enters school.</p>

<p>As all educational methods have for their
ultimate object that of making the child of
today the good neighbor, the true friend, the
useful citizen of tomorrow, so we have a right
to question the recent and growing demand
for story-telling in our schools. What is its
object? Does this object aid in the ultimate
end to be attained?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>First of all let us consider the well-recognized
fact that through story-telling a teacher
may come into so close and happy a relationship
with her pupils that they will respond
to her suggestions and be molded by her
influence to a degree not easily attainable by
any other means. A story may be told as a
means of restoring order in a roomful of
restless children, or when some untoward
occurrence has brought the tension of school
discipline dangerously near to the breaking
point. This use of the timely, the appropriate,
story is worthy of consideration by teachers
far beyond the primary grades.</p>

<p>Stories may be used as an aid to language
work. The diffident, self-conscious child who
cannot be induced to talk upon the ordinary
topics of school work, can be aroused into
forgetfulness of self and made to respond
with growing animation to questions regarding
a story that has awakened his interest.
A “point of contact” may be established
with even the dullest child if his interests are
studied and the right story chosen for telling.
Sometimes the story may need to be improvised
to fit the occasion. A story chosen, or
especially written to meet the need of some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
particular child, has in more than one instance
influenced his whole after life.</p>

<p>Lessons of unselfishness, of thoughtfulness,
of cleanliness, of patriotism, of obedience—of
all the characteristics which we wish to
cultivate in the children—may be impressed
by means of stories. This field of story-telling
should begin in the home, but it may
well extend on into the school room.</p>

<p>A love of nature and of out-door life may
be strengthened by stories of birds and animals,
of trees and of plant life, thus leading
naturally to essays and poems upon the same
subjects for later reading.</p>

<p>The funny story has its legitimate place in
the school room, although there are teachers
who would as soon think of introducing a bit
of fun into a church service as into a school
session. But fun is a wonderful lubricant,
and there are times when a funny story will
oil up the pedagogical machinery as nothing
else could.</p>

<p>In the more advanced grades stories may
be used to awaken an interest in history, both
local and general, ancient and modern. Nothing
better can be devised for making the dry
bones of names and dates take on life, than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
the telling of an interesting story of the time
and the characters of the lesson. Such stories
should not be told as an end in themselves,
but as a means to an end—the awakening
of interest in historical subjects by giving life
and reality to historical characters.</p>

<p>In the same manner an interest in the
works of the best authors may be aroused
by telling the story of one character in a
book, or by telling part of the story of a book
and leaving it at an interesting point. There
are many children, boys especially, who leave
school after passing through the seventh or
eighth grade. If they have not formed a
taste for good literature, their reading after
leaving school is likely to be without value
if it is not positively injurious. One of the
surest means of leading such boys to read
and enjoy good books lies in the hands of
the teachers of these grades. Let her tell
stories from Dickens, from Scott, from
Cooper, from Stevenson; let her tell stories
from local history, general history; stories
of discovery, of science, and of art. Let her
make these things attractive, and show her
pupils where more of the same fascinating
material may be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>So thoroughly is the value of this class of
story-telling understood that progressive
librarians throughout the country are having
“story hours” at the libraries for the purpose
of reaching boys of this age and bringing
them into closer touch with the treasures
of the library shelves. Teachers in districts
having any large percentage of boys of this
class can accomplish far-reaching results by
devoting some portion of each week, at least,
to telling stories having this special end in
view.</p>

<p>With the foregoing objects—a sympathetic
understanding between teacher and
pupils, better discipline, help for the self-conscious
and the “dull” pupil, character
lessons, the development of a love of nature,
an interest in history and in good literature—all
attainable through story-telling, there
remains little ground for question as to the
work coinciding in its results with the ultimate
object of our common school education.
But let the teacher have a definite object in
her story-telling. Let her use this new-old
art as a means of arousing her pupils to
action, to achievement. A story told in school
should not be offered as a sugary, educational<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
confection which will destroy the taste
for solid food, but as a spicy condiment to
whet the appetite for a substantial feast.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">How to Choose Stories for Telling</span></h3>

</div>

<p>There are certain subtle qualities which
a story must possess in order to give
pleasure through its telling, which are not
necessary in the story which is to be read.
These qualities are of form rather than of
substance. They are those qualities which
permit of the personality of the speaker
entering into the narrative to such an extent
that the story becomes a recounting of something
<i>known to her</i>. No matter how remote
in point of time or place, the story must be
of a character which can be personally set
forth. I do not mean by this that the one
who tells the story should be thrown into the
foreground, or that there should be any use
of the pronoun “I”; but simply that the
teller of the story should be able to set it
forth with all the earnestness and intimacy
of a personal narrative, and the story itself
must therefore possess the form which makes
this possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>A story of this character may be so told
to a roomful of small children that it will
hold them breathless with interest even at
the close of a hard day’s work, and <i>when
the dismissal bell is ringing</i>, as the writer
has inadvertently proved.</p>

<p>To some, the story that is adapted in substance
and in form for telling, makes instant
appeal. Its possibilities are intuitively recognized.
To others, only a critical examination
and analysis will show whether the story
is one to which children will listen with
delight. Of course, after all is said and done,
the true test of the story lies in telling it.</p>

<p>What, then, are the essential requirements
in the form of the story?</p>

<p>The story must begin in an interesting
way. The first sentence, or at most the first
paragraph, should locate the story and introduce
its hero. To be sure the “location”
may be that delightfully indefinite past from
which so many of childhood’s stories emanate—the
“Once upon a time” of the fairy tale
or of the “little small Rid Hin”; or it may
be “many years ago”; or “in ancient times,”
as in the story of “Why the Cat and Dog
Are Enemies”; or simply “once”—“There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
was once a shepherd boy who called ‘Wolf,’”
or “The Sun and the Wind once had a
quarrel.”</p>

<p>Of course the time may, on the other hand,
be very definite—“’Twas the night before
Christmas”—but in either case the story
starts out positively, the place or time is
assigned, the subject of the story is introduced.
Then you will see the children, their
expectation aroused, settle themselves for the
delightful developments which are to be unfolded,
for the denouement which is sure to
follow, and their eager faces are all the
incentive needed to arouse the story-teller to
her best endeavor.</p>

<p>The story, properly introduced, should
move forward clearly, somewhat concisely,
toward a well-defined end or climax. The
form should be mainly narrative or conversational,
with vivid touches of description
never prolonged. There should be life, action,
dramatic action, but very little of explanation.
The incidents of the story should be
so arranged as to be self-explanatory in their
sequence.</p>

<p>For small children, repetition has a special
charm—repetition such as is to be found in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
“The Three Bears,” or “The Cock and the
Mouse.”</p>

<p>For older children there may be introduced
a little more of the descriptive form, but it
is well to beware of adding much of either
description or explanation. Even “grown-ups”
enjoy the straightforward narrative
that delights the child, and the introduction
of detail soon grows irksome and uninteresting,
even to the most conscientious listener.
And no child is a “conscientious listener.”
He listens for love of the story. If it does
not interest him he stops listening and does
something else.</p>

<p>The story must reach a climax and stop
there. Many a good story has been spoiled
by its ending. Story-tellers sometimes remind
one of a man holding the handles of an
electric battery. The current is so strong
that he cannot let go. The story-teller must
know when and how to “let go.” Let us
suppose that, in telling Hans Christian Anderson’s
story of “The Nightingale,” the
story-teller—after the delightful denouement
of the supposedly dead Emperor’s
greeting to his attendants, where he “to their
astonishment said ‘Good morning!’”—were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
to add an explanation of the effect of
the nightingale’s song in restoring the Emperor
to health! It would be like offering a
glass of “plain soda” from which all the
effervescence had departed.</p>

<p>Bring the story to its self-wrought denouement
and—let go. Do not apologize for the
ending, do not explain it, do not tack on a
moral—just “let go,” and you will leave
all the tingle and exhilaration of the magnetic
current still in the veins of your listeners.</p>

<p>So much for the structural form of the
story. Next let us consider its</p>

<h4><i>Point of Contact</i></h4>

<p>Has the story something which is in common
with the life and experience of the
listeners? Has it a familiar groundwork?
Does it deal with familiar objects or actions?
In other words, is it “understandable”
from the child’s point of view? Not that all
the characters nor all the adjustments of the
story need to be those which the child already
knows by experience, but there must be some
common ground from which a start may be
made. Then the story may lead on into wonderful
regions of fancy or into remote times<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
and places which only the imagination can
trace. For instance, of what value or interest
would the story of “Toads and Diamonds”
be to a child who never had seen
a toad and who had no knowledge of what
a diamond was like? And does not the boy’s
understanding of “How Thor Went Fishing”
lie in the fact that <i>he</i> has fished?</p>

<p>Little children love to be told stories of the
life which they know by daily contact; stories
of the home and of the home industries, of
school, of children, of pets and animals. They
live in “a daily fellowship with nature and
all creatures.” Fairy tales and stories of
animals are doubly delightful when the
fairies and the animals do the things which
children do. This does not imply that the
story be commonplace, for the normal activities
of children are far removed from the
commonplace, and the story, having its point
of contact established, should, through its
imaginative or its moral influence, carry the
child into quite unexplored regions of beauty
and truth.</p>

<p>This leads us to another determining factor—<i>the</i>
determining factor—in choosing a
story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<h4><i>Is It Worth Telling?</i></h4>

<p>The structural form of a story may be
changed; with more difficulty a point of contact
may be established by a bit of suggestive
explanation, but if the story content is
not good, no amount of “doctoring” will
make it worth the telling.</p>

<p>Suppose we apply these tests: Is the effect
of the story helpful? Does it strengthen the
imagination? Does it teach a right principle
of action? Does it inspire a love for the
beautiful and the true? Does it inspire reverence
for the Creator and appreciation of
the works of His hand? Does it exemplify
sane and happy living? Does it teach neighborly
kindness? Will its telling make a child
better and happier? If the story calls for
an affirmative answer to any of these questions,
if, in other words, its teaching is simple,
pure, and true, then it is by all means
worthy of telling.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that the story should
make no mention of selfishness, of craftiness,
of evil temper, or of disobedience to laws
moral or physical; but no story in which evil
is rewarded or in which the wrongdoer triumphs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
should ever be told to children, for
in its essence such a story is not true, its
teaching is not true; it is not in accord with
God’s eternal laws. Children assimilate long
before they analyze.</p>

<p>At first glance it may seem easy to decide
as to the moral influence of a story, but there
are differences of opinion even here, and
some writers condemn unsparingly that old
acquaintance of our childhood, Jack, of Bean-stalk
fame, and set him down as an arrant
thief and murderer whose crimes brought him
riches and comfort in his old age. And the
tale of Cinderella, while it can be said to
cast no stain upon the character of its heroine,
is condemned as leaving an impression,
upon the impressionable mind of childhood,
that all step-mothers are hard and cruel and
unjust. As the Mother Goose stories are
dealt with at greater length in a later chapter,
I will make no comment now upon these
criticisms. But they are worthy of due consideration,
and go to show that it is not
always as easy as it may at first appear, to
judge the exact influence of a story, and some
of our old acquaintances which have been
accepted simply because they are old acquaintances,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
may really need to be given the
“cut direct.”</p>

<p>This much is safe to say: If you have any
doubts about the influence of a story being
wholly good, leave it untold. There are so
many good stories, so many whose teaching
is wholly and positively helpful, that there
is no need of hesitating over one which
presents a doubt.</p>

<p>There is one more qualification which
should be required of the story told to children.
It should be written in</p>

<h4><i>Good Literary Form</i></h4>

<p>Since one of the objects of story-telling
is to cultivate a taste for good literature, the
story chosen should not only be tellable in
its form and true in its essence, but it should
be artistic in its workmanship. It should
be written in pure, simple English, fitted to
the thought expressed. But, it may be objected,
few story-tellers ever give a story in
the exact language in which it is written.
This is true, for if the story is learned word
for word, the narrator is very apt to give a
recitation, rather than to tell a story. At
the same time the true story-teller will learn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
her story so thoroughly, will become so at
home in every essential detail, that the spirit
and style of the writer will be assimilated
and so bound up with the story itself that the
literary qualities will be retained and their
essence imparted to the orally reproduced
story. So, only, can appreciation and love
for the beauty of literary forms be imparted
to the children by means of the verbal story.
Herein lies the <i>art</i> of the story-teller.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">The Telling of the Story</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Having chosen the right story for telling,
the next consideration is how to
tell it in the best manner possible.</p>

<p>Aside from all question of voice, enunciation,
ease of manner—which, though important,
are more or less matters of personal
habit or physical endowment—there are two
absolute essentials to successful story-telling:
a thorough knowledge of the story, and
forgetfulness of self.</p>

<p>The best story may be spoiled by the manner
of telling. A good story told by a master
of the art will be a source of delight, while
the same story told by a self-conscious,
poorly prepared novice will be annoyingly
tiresome.</p>

<p>The first step in the preparation, then,
must be a thorough assimilation of the story.
This does not involve memorizing, but the
substance of the story must be made your
own. Formulate in your own mind its plan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
or outline. What is its climax? What are
the essential facts leading to this climax?
How do they follow, in order to bring about
the final surprise or culmination?</p>

<p>Having this outline well fixed in mind,
begin to fill in details. Note the bits of wit
or of wisdom which strengthen the story;
the apt phrases or happy turns of expression
which exactly fit the thought. Memorize
these, and these only. Think the story over,
again and again, until it becomes a personal
possession—something which you <i>know</i>.
Then begin formulating it. You can do this
mentally, inaudibly at first, following the general
mode of expression of the written story,
so that you will tell it in a manner which
conforms to the literary style of the author.
This is not difficult, for if you have selected
a well-written story, the style in which it is
written will be in keeping with its character
and will seem the natural mode of expression.
This assimilation of style as well as of substance
takes the place of literal memorizing.
It allows full liberty in the telling, while
memorizing only cramps and hampers.</p>

<p>Repeat the story mentally until you not
only know its substance as a personal experience,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
but until you are so familiar with its
literary style that you could scarcely tell
that particular story in any other form.
This assimilation of style as well as of substance
takes time, but the ability to learn a
story readily will come with practice. After
you have mastered the <i>method</i> of learning,
you will be able to acquire new stories with
little difficulty.</p>

<p>You are now ready to tell the story orally;
not at once to an audience—at least not until
you have gained sufficient experience to know
to just what extent you can depend upon
yourself—but to an imaginary assembly. A
doll makes a very good “practice auditor,”
and is not inclined to encourage you overmuch
by her responsiveness. If your imagination
is good, a sofa pillow or a chair will do
as well. You will probably make your first
audible effort at an opportune moment when
you are left quite alone in the house, and the
first opening door will bring the rehearsal
to a definite close. But in time, if you persevere,
the family will become used to it. As
for yourself, however, you will probably find
that an amused audience of one, even though
unseen, is more conducive to self-consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
than an interested audience of one
hundred.</p>

<p>A teacher presenting a story to her own
class of pupils will not, of course, have so
many difficulties to overcome. She and the
children are on a familiar footing; she talks
to them every day; she knows the number
and responsiveness of her audience, the size
of the room, the carrying power of her own
voice. She is scarcely conscious that these
factors enter into the success of story-telling.
But when a story-teller addresses an unknown
audience, these factors assume unexpected
importance.</p>

<p>I have in mind an early experience when
a story hour was arranged at one of the
branch libraries of a large city. I knew that
the “fifty-seven varieties” of childhood were
accustomed to assemble there and that the
room was not large, but I was not prepared
to find two hundred children compressed
within little more than two hundred square
feet of space. My natural voice proved
wholly inadequate. I began, but saw at once
that the children at the farther end of the
room could not hear, and I stopped. Taking
a more central position, I found an entirely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
new voice—one so much higher pitched that
I am sure I should never have recognized it
as my own, elsewhere—and I told the stories.
The new voice carried, and under the conditions
sounded wholly normal. The children
grew quiet, and for nearly an hour we traveled
together through fairy-land, across western
prairies, along the streets of Hamelin town,
into the Empire of Japan, and among the
Korean folk. How we did enjoy it!</p>

<p>The incident taught me two things at least:
one, the value of having an intimate knowledge
of the stories to be told, so that no unexpectedness
of conditions could cause them
to take flight; the other, the necessity of
being able to adapt oneself to unexpected
conditions.</p>

<p>The need of adapting the story, or the
mode of telling, to the requirements of the
immediate occasion, can only be learned by
watching your audience.</p>

<p>Be sure your voice reaches the farthest
child in the room. You need not use a loud
tone, but a little difference in the pitch will
make a great difference in the carrying quality.
If the children must exert themselves,
hold themselves tense, in order to hear, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
will soon relax the effort and become restless
and indifferent.</p>

<p>If a child becomes inattentive, address your
story to him for a time, and turn to him
frequently afterward. Each child loves to
feel that the story is being told to <i>him</i>. For
this reason, the story and the children are
the only things to be taken account of. The
story should be told directly to the <i>individual</i>
children, not to the <i>mass</i> of children.</p>

<p>At a recent story hour the children were
grouped upon the left hand side of the large
audience room, and the older people, of whom
there were a goodly number, upon the right
hand side. A small cousin of the story-teller—aged
three—who had heard the stories
until he could tell them himself, sat upon his
grandfather’s lap on the “grown-up” side
of the room.</p>

<p>The story-teller devoted her attention to
the children’s side of the room exclusively.
She began with the story of “Raggylug,”
by Ernest Thompson-Seton. The moment the
story was finished, a small voice from the
neglected side of the room demanded, “Now
tell it to <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>The incident is used to show that each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
child wants to feel that the story is being
told to him, and emphasizes the need of telling
stories with a personal directness of
appeal.</p>

<p>I have said that the story and the children
should be the only things of which the story-teller
takes note. A consciousness of one’s
own self as the actor upon the boards, spoils
all.</p>

<p>This self-consciousness may be betrayed
by a nervous twirling of a handkerchief, a
twisting of rings or bracelet, by an arranging
of the hair or the dress. It may be but a
slight action in itself, but it betrays the fault
which will be felt, though probably not
defined.</p>

<p>Forget yourself. Become so interested in
your story that you can think of nothing else—except
the children who are drinking it in.</p>

<p>You may safely use as much dramatic
action as springs spontaneously from a vivid
telling of the story, but it must never be a
conscious effort for dramatic effect. Give
yourself perfect liberty. As you watch your
audience, interpolate, enlarge, omit, explain
briefly, as you see the need arise—but you
can only do this if you <i>know</i> your story. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
changes made should all be kept in harmony
with the style of the original narrative, and
used only in order to stimulate or to arouse
your hearers to a quicker perception or a
better understanding.</p>

<p>Take time to bring out the essence of the
tale, to impress the beauty of the description,
to enhance the humor of a situation. A story
should never be hurriedly told, any more
than it should be hurriedly prepared.</p>

<p>It is quite possible for the same story to
be so told as to teach exactly opposite lessons,
and yet without any alteration of the essential
facts. This point is well illustrated by
the story of “Robin Hood and Sir Richard-at-the-Lea,”
taken as an example. In this
story it would be easy to call undue attention
to Robin Hood as the “robber outlaw.” On
the other hand, it is equally easy, by a few
wise omissions, or a difference in handling,
to make prominent the characteristics which
caused him to be loved by all his “merrie
men,” trusted by the poor and helpless, and
worshipped as a hero by the boys of all succeeding
generations. This difference in handling
applies to nearly all of the Robin Hood
stories, and to many of the old nursery tales<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
as well. They illustrate the point which I
have made, that the same story may be so
written, or so told, as to leave entirely different
impressions upon the mind.</p>

<p>The story-teller may not as a rule require
special training in the use of the speaking
voice, but it is essential that she enunciate
easily, clearly, and agreeably. A well modulated
voice tires neither speaker nor hearer.</p>

<p>To summarize—</p>

<p>Know your story; know it so thoroughly
that it is flexible under your handling, yielding
easily to the varying conditions under
which it is told while retaining all its essential
qualities of style and of substance:</p>

<p>See that your voice carries:</p>

<p>Forget yourself:</p>

<p>Do not hurry:</p>

<p>Bring out the true essence of the tale:</p>

<p>Tell it with directness of appeal to your
immediate audience:</p>

<p>Carry it to its climax:</p>

<p>“Let go.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">Use of the Story in Primary Grades</span></h3>

</div>

<p>In the primary grades of the schools,
stories may be told as a relaxation, as
an incentive to learning to read, and as a
means of enlarging the vocabulary of the
little people and thereby giving them greater
freedom of self-expression. In the more advanced
grades the story is used to awaken
interest in new subjects, to fix the essentials
of a lesson, and to cultivate a taste for the
best in literature. But in all the grades, as
well as in the home, it may be made the
means of carrying home a lesson or of clinching
a truth.</p>

<p>The use of the story in the primary grades
coincides in some degree with its use in the
home, but it goes much further. The old
method of primary teaching whereby a child
was made by laborious exercises to <i>learn to
read</i> in order that he might be able in later
years to enjoy the treasures of literature, has
undergone a radical and healthful change.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
Under the former method, the child, through
the barrenness of his labor, was often discouraged
in his attempt to master reading,
and he had but a dim idea at best of the
benefit which was to accrue to him from
learning.</p>

<p>Under present methods, the child, before
he is given any of the laborious drill work—which
is as essential as ever to his learning
to read for himself—is told stories, is led
into the beautiful realms of literature, and is
made to realize what is in store for him when
he has mastered the technical difficulties of
reading. After that, the drills and the oral
stories are carried on together, and the
stories form a tempting incentive to hard
work upon the drills. Children are willing
to work, and to work hard, if they see a
desirable object to be attained.</p>

<p>The primary teacher who makes judicious
use of stories in her class room lays hold
upon one of the most efficient aids to successful
work. But when a story has been
told to the children, it has but half served
its purpose. If it was worth telling, it is
worth remembering; and there is no means
by which the story may be so thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
impressed upon the child’s mind as by his
telling it himself.</p>

<p>The first advantage gained lies in the fact
that if the child knows that he is likely to
be called upon to re-tell the story, he will
listen more intently, more acutely. This in
itself helps him, because he learns to be
attentive, and to concentrate his thoughts.
When he tries to re-tell the story, if he
has not grasped the essentials or cannot
follow the sequence, then he will have to listen
again—more carefully, this time—and he
will have shown wherein he needs help.</p>

<p>With very young children, it is a good
plan to talk the story over, after it has been
told, bringing out the essential facts, and so
forming a framework or outline upon which
the child can more readily rebuild the story.</p>

<p>The opportunity which the reproduction of
a story affords of helping the child to express
himself in clear, correct English, and to
enlarge his vocabulary, is of exceptional
value. At the same time his absorption in
the story itself overcomes his timidity or self-consciousness
to a wonderful degree, and
often arouses a child from a dull lethargy
of indifference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>Again, no reading lesson will admit of the
freedom of expression in face, tone, and general
attitude which the telling of a story
permits. Why? Because the child enjoys it.
It is a natural thing to him, while reading,
in the early grades, is unnatural.</p>

<p>Teachers should be careful not to let the
children who are eager to re-tell the story,
monopolize the time. It is those who are shy
and backward who need the exercise most.
The eager ones may lead the way, but the
shy ones should be encouraged to follow.</p>

<p>Dramatization goes a step farther than
reproduction. The dramatizing or playing of
a story makes it take on life and reality for
the child. When he hears a story read or
told he forms a mental picture which is more
or less hazy and easily dispelled. When he
has for himself played the story, assumed
one of the characters, and acted its part, then
the thought of the story becomes crystallized.
He grasps its meaning, sees its beauty, understands
its truth, and <i>remembers</i> it. This
intensifying of his mental pictures results in
more expressive reading as well as in better
language work and in greater power of self-expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>Another distinct advantage gained through
dramatizing is the bringing of the life of
literature into direct contact with the child’s
life, and so causing all literature to become
more real and vital.</p>

<p>The play—for so it seems to the child—forms
a connecting link between the home or
play-life to which he has been accustomed,
and the new and strange life of the school.
It helps to banish diffidence, and to establish
a familiar atmosphere and a spirit of fellowship
with the teacher and the other pupils.
It is also a source of pure joy to the child,
and “the education that brings joy along
with careful and exact training is better than
the kind that omits the joy.” Would that
every teacher might remember this!</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that while dramatizing
in the schoolroom may be helpful and
vitalizing when under the control of a teacher
who recognizes its educational value, it may,
on the other hand, become inane and even
silly if used simply as an amusement or as
a time-filler.</p>

<p>While much of the value of dramatizing
must depend upon the insight and oversight
of the teacher, much also depends upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
selection of material. “Not what <i>may</i> be
dramatized, but what <i>should</i> be.”</p>

<p>If a teacher has clearly before her the
thought of <i>why</i> we dramatize, then the question
of <i>what</i> to dramatize will be more readily
determined.</p>

<p>Stories of nature, in which the children
represent birds, bees, flowers, the wind, the
seasons, are all useful for the purpose. Such
stories quicken the imagination and bring the
child into closer relationship with out-door
life.</p>

<p>An especially good example of a story to
dramatize is the “Lesson of Faith,” in the
first chapter of this book. Teachers will find
this story especially appropriate to their
Easter exercises.</p>

<p>After the story has been told often enough
for the children to become familiar with its
thought and outline, let some little girl represent
the Caterpillar, and another the Butterfly.
Have a boy represent the Lark, and
eight or ten other children the butterfly eggs.</p>

<p>Begin the dramatizing by having this last
group of children curl themselves down quietly
together, while the little girl who represents
the Caterpillar moves slowly about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
near them. Then let the Butterfly, slowly
moving her wings, settle beside the Caterpillar
and address her, telling her of the little
eggs, and asking her to care for them. Then
have the Butterfly droop her wings and
become quiet, as though dead. It is best,
then, to allow this child to resume her seat
while the others carry on the little play.</p>

<p>Next have the Caterpillar indulge in her
soliloquy, and presently the Lark should come
flying to her side. Then follows the dialogue
between the two, the Lark flying away and
returning as described in the story.</p>

<p>As the Caterpillar declares that the Lark
is making fun of her when he tells her that
she will one day be a butterfly herself, have
the little butterfly eggs—now caterpillars—begin
to move about, one brushing against
her, and let them begin to nibble as though
eating.</p>

<p>After the Caterpillar has shown her great
surprise, have her show her great joy at
learning that the Lark’s message is true.
Then she should go to one or two of the
children in the seats, who represent the Caterpillar’s
friends, and tell them the great
good news which she has learned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>They are to show their unbelief of what
she has said.</p>

<p>Next have these friends come to her and
tell her that it is time for her to form her
chrysalis and die.</p>

<p>Then the Caterpillar becomes very still,
the little green caterpillars, meanwhile, eating
and moving about very quietly.</p>

<p>As the final act of the little drama, have
the Butterfly emerge from her chrysalis,
spread her wings, and fly away.</p>

<p>This story answers perfectly to the requirements
of dramatization, and it is clearly
not one which <i>may</i> be dramatized, but one
which <i>should</i> be. The children who take part,
and those who look on at the little play, will
have their mental conception of the story,
which was first given in words only, intensified;
made real and lasting.</p>

<p>When children imitate, say, the robin or
the crow, see that their motions accord with
those of the bird represented—have them
hop like the robin, or walk like the crow.
The eagle and the swallow fly poised on outstretched
wing, while the humming bird’s
wings move rapidly. All these differences,
if noted, teach the children to observe. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
a child makes a mistake, such as hopping
when representing the crow, do not tell him
what his mistake is, but have him find out
before the next day how the crow moves when
on the ground. This is of especial value if
he can have an opportunity of watching a
crow for himself, since it teaches him to
observe closely; to use his own eyes.</p>

<p>Fairy and folk tales afford excellent material
for dramatizing, as do some of the
familiar mythological stories. They quicken
the child’s imagination by helping him to
understand the personification of the forces
of nature, and this understanding is greatly
helped if he not only hears and reads the
stories, but plays them as well.</p>

<p>The story of Midas is well adapted for
dramatizing. Choose a boy to represent the
avaricious king, and another boy for Bacchus,
who bestows upon him the golden touch.
Other children, either boys or girls, may be
selected to typify the apple tree and the rose
bush—moving their leaves in the breeze till
stiffened by Midas’ touch. A little girl must,
of course, personify Midas’ little daughter.</p>

<p>After all these have been turned to gold,
Midas visits Bacchus and implores his aid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
in getting rid of the fatal power which has
been given to him. Then he returns with
joy and restores the apple tree, the rose, and,
best of all, his own little daughter, to life.
The details of the story will have to be
worked out according to the version chosen,
but the story is too well known and too
readily found, to make it worth while to give
it in detail here.</p>

<p>The reproduction of a story also through
constructive mediums—clay modeling, painting,
or paper cutting—helps the child to a
physical application of the knowledge which
he has gained, and so strengthens the impression
which has been made.</p>

<p>A little further on, when lessons in nature
study, geography, and history are about to
be introduced, the child can be led into them
almost unconsciously, through talks and
stories of nature, of travel, of foreign countries,
and of biography and history. Under
this method of teaching, children are made
to realize that history is a narrative of real
events, directed by people who did great
things, great enough for the whole country
or the whole world to be interested in, and
the men of history become heroes of flesh
and blood; geography steps out from between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
the covers of a book and becomes a multiplied
home, the home of many people and
of many races, each home possessing characteristics
which interest and appeal to the
child; nature study becomes an introduction
to new friends clothed in feathers and fur.</p>

<p>When stories are reproduced in the school
room the work should not be undertaken as
a formal language drill. The story should be
left to make its appeal to the childish imagination
and should then be expressed in his
own words. Let the exact drill upon words
be done with sentences which are designed
for that purpose, but let the reproduction of
any story which is worthy of a place in literature
be a spontaneous expression upon the
part of the child, so that the life and beauty
of the story may be preserved to him. A
story loses its grace and its ethical value
when hammered into a rigid form of words.
Word drill is right and proper in its place,
but the reproduction of a worth-while story
demands that the thought be kept living and
active, and the form of expression free.</p>

<span class="smaller">Jingles, Fables, and Folk-Lore</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The first stories told to a child are almost
invariably the Mother Goose rhymes
and jingles, beginning perhaps with:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker’s man!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So I will, master, as fast as I can:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pat it, and prick it, and mark it with T,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And toss in the oven for Tommy and me.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Or this, from the <i>Chinese Mother Goose</i>
(Fleming H. Revell Company):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Pat, pat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A swallow’s nest we’ll make,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And if we pat some money out</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">We’ll buy ourselves a cake.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">These are usually accompanied by appropriate
finger plays.</p>

<p>Can we give a tangible reason for this
choice? Why do all mothers turn to them
with unwavering fidelity? Why do all children
love them?</p>

<p>There can be but one answer. Before a
child is able to follow the thread of the simplest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
story, he can enjoy the musical cadence
of these rhymes. There is rhythm in their
measure, an allurement of sound in their
words and phrases which pleases his ear and
satisfies his senses long before their words
carry any intelligent thought to his mind.</p>

<p>Why are “memory gems” taught in the
primary grades of the schools? The children
understand but little of their true beauty of
thought, but the cadence of the lines fixes
them in the memory, and the deeper meaning
comes with later years.</p>

<p>It is because this is so, because the children
love musical cadence before they understand
words, that mothers can follow or
mingle the Mother Goose melodies with more
modern verses such as those of Field or
Stevenson. The little child will love such
lines as these, by Henry van Dyke:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I guess the pussy-willows now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are creeping out on every bough</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Along the brook; and robins look</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For early worms behind the plough.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Or the introduction to “The Fountain,” in
James Russell Lowell’s <i>Poems</i> (Houghton,
Mifflin Company):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Into the sunshine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Full of the light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leaping and flashing</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From morn till night.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Into the moonlight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whiter than snow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Waving so flower-like</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When the winds blow.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Into the star-light</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Rushing in spray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Happy at midnight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Happy by day.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The true poetry of these lines will not
appeal to him in the beginning, but the
cadence of the lines will, and they will become
fixed in his mind. The beauty of the poems
will be his in later years.</p>

<p>As soon as a child is old enough to follow
the thread of a simple story, fables and folk-lore
will lead him into the realm of the
world’s earliest literature. These are the
stories which delighted the race in its childhood,
and they have delighted childhood in
all succeeding generations. These old fables
are so familiar that they are incorporated
into our everyday conversation. How often
do we refer to “The Hare and the Tortoise,”
to the “Dog in the Manger,” or to “The
Goose That Laid the Golden Egg?” How<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
frequently do we illustrate a point by a reference
to “Sour Grapes,” or to “A Wolf in
Sheep’s Clothing?” Yet probably not one
in twenty knows that all these familiar illustrations
find their origin in the fables of
Aesop or La Fontaine.</p>

<p>These old classic fables are a part of the
literature “which the world has chosen to
remember.” They have become a part of the
literary coin of the realm. In his introduction
to Aesop’s Fables, Joseph Jacobs says:
“In their grotesque grace, in their quaint
humor, in their trust in the simpler virtues,
in their insight into the cruder vices, in their
innocence of the fact of sex, Aesop’s Fables
are as little children.” As an example:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It happened that a fisher, after fishing all day, caught
only a little fish. “Pray, let me go, master,” said the
fish. “I am much too small for your eating just now.
If you put me back into the river I shall soon grow,
then you can make a fine meal off me.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, my little fish,” said the fisher, “I have
you now. I may not catch you hereafter.”</p>

</div>

<p>It has been well said that the fables are
the child’s best introduction to the study of
human nature. They are “an interpretation
of life.” That animals are made to talk, and
to exhibit human traits, only adds to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
charm of the story without lessening its
ethical value. The child applies to all nature
his own standard of ethics.</p>

<p>The child’s ability to understand is far in
advance of his ability to read, and the old
folk-tales which have been handed down
orally from generation to generation, and
later gathered into volumes for the children
of all nations to enjoy together, are a veritable
mine of delight to both story-teller and
listener.</p>

<p>Folk tales and fairy tales are so interwoven
that it is difficult to separate them. That
some of both are open to criticism is conceded,
but with such abundance of supply
there is no need of telling a story which
presents even a doubt as to its value.</p>

<p>In her introduction to “The Story Hour,”
Kate Douglas Wiggin says: “Some universal
spiritual truth underlies the really fine
old fairy tale; but there can be no educational
influence in the so-called fairy stories,
which are merely jumbles of impossible incidents,
and which not infrequently present
dishonesty, deceit, and cruelty in attractive
or amusing guise.” Here we have the true
test which anyone may apply: an underlying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
“universal spiritual truth.” Does our story
contain such?</p>

<p>Two very familiar nursery tales which owe
their origin to the folk-lore of old—namely,
“Jack, the Giant Killer,” and “Cinderella”—have
recently been brought into question
upon the ground of their moral teaching.
The critics in question look upon Jack as a
thief and a murderer, who “lived happily
ever after” upon his ill-gotten gains. For
my own part, I find less to condemn in Jack’s
treatment of the Giant, than in making a
hero of a boy who was lazy and disobedient.
The Giant had robbed and killed Jack’s
father, and he was wicked and cruel to all,
and Jack could scarcely be blamed for trying
to regain his father’s stolen wealth, or for
cutting down the bean-stalk when the Giant
was descending for the purpose of killing
him and, in all probability, his mother. But
the false note in the story, to my mind, lies
in selecting a boy who was avowedly lazy,
idle, disobedient, and neglectful of his mother,
for the hero of a tale of such marvelous
deeds. The tale of Jack, the Giant Killer,
however, has many versions, and there is no
need whatever, when telling the story, of giving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
to Jack any of these undesirable traits.
Rather, picture him as a boy capable of performing
heroic deeds. The change is easily
made.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I would champion the
story of “Cinderella.” The recent criticism
brought against this story is that it leads
boys and girls to believe that all step-mothers
are cruel. I do not think so. The stories
of “The Babes in the Woods,” and of “The
Princes in the Tower,” do not teach that all
uncles are cruel. Of course the fact that
Cinderella’s step-mother was a <i>step</i>-mother
might be so emphasized in the telling as to
give this impression, but it is not emphasized
in the story—not, at least, in most of the
versions which I have read. Selfishness and
pride are set forth in the half-sisters in all
their unattractiveness; while Cinderella’s
final triumph serves as a means of showing
her gentle and forgiving nature. These are
the points to be brought out in the story-telling,
and it would seem to me to be an unjustifiable
robbery to take the story of Cinderella
from the child’s early store of fairy tales.
What a thrill of exquisite delight is felt
by the child when the magic of the god-mother’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
wand turns Cinderella’s rags into
the robe of a princess and she is whirled
away in her golden chariot to meet the prince.
It is a story of goodness rewarded and of evil
punished, but all in such a magical and wonderful
way! I can feel the early thrill of it
yet—and so can you.</p>

<p>There are different versions of both these
stories, and it is not a difficult matter to tell
either one in such a way as to do away with
all objectionable features. As was shown in
a previous chapter, much of the impression
which a story leaves is due to the manner of
its telling. The story of Cinderella certainly
contains the “underlying universal, spiritual
truth,” and so answers to the test of a truly
“fine old fairy tale.”</p>

<p>American story tellers should not go far
afield for their tales of folk lore, and overlook
the two distinctive sources afforded by our
own country. The stories of the North American
Indian, told by camp fire or in tepee, are
full of poetic imagery, of symbolic truth, and
of heroic valor. They form the original
legendary lore of our land, and they should be
told to the children, preparing them for a
later reading of the poets and authors who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
have shown us the picturesque as well as the
tragic side of the history of the Red Man.</p>

<p>The other American source of folk lore
tales is found in the south, and is typified at
its best in “Uncle Remus,” though not confined
to him. As has been said, the dialect
story is difficult for a child to read, and Uncle
Remus is undoubtedly most thoroughly appreciated
by children of a larger growth. But
no child can resist the drollery or the rollicking
fun of the true darkey story when it is
<i>told</i> to him.</p>

<p>The following story of “Ithenthiela”
which closes this chapter is a good example
of the folk lore tales of the Indian. Only a
portion of the original story is here given,
but it is to be found, with other good stories
for telling, in <i>Tales of the Red Children</i>, by
Abbie F. Brown, and James M. Bell (D.
Appleton and Company).</p>

<h4>“The Story of Ithenthiela”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></h4>

<p>Many years ago there was a brave Indian
boy named Ithenthiela, the Caribou-Footed,
who lived far away in the great northwest.</p>

<p>One day, as Ithenthiela went through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
woods, he saw a squirrel in the branches of
a tall red spruce tree, and, raising his bow,
he shot an arrow at it. Down fell the squirrel,
but the arrow lodged in the branches.</p>

<p>Then Ithenthiela started to climb after the
arrow, but he had not climbed far when he
heard a great pack of wolves howling at the
foot of the tree. So he climbed higher, and
as he mounted, the arrow went up, too.</p>

<p>Up, up, it went, until at last it came to the
sky itself. The arrow passed through the
thin blue, and Ithenthiela wriggled after it.</p>

<p>Great was Ithenthiela’s surprise when he
entered the Sky Country; it was so different
from what he had expected. He had imagined
a glorious country where the sun always
shone, and where huge herds of musk-oxen,
caribou, and moose roamed at large. He had
expected to find many of his own people
camped in wigwams here and there, preparing
to fight with other tribes. But instead,
the air was damp, dreary, and cold; no trees
or flowers grew; no herds of animals ran on
the silent plains; the smoke of no wigwam
greeted his anxious eyes; no war-whoop or
hunting cry was heard. But far in the distance
against the sky shimmered a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
white mass, like a pile of snow when the sun
shines upon it in the early summer. Toward
this great white wonder ran a winding path
from the very spot where Ithenthiela stood.</p>

<p>“I will follow it,” thought he, “and see
what I find in that shining wigwam over
there.”</p>

<p>As he passed along he met an old woman
who said to him: “Who are you, and where
are you going?”</p>

<p>“I have come from far,” said Ithenthiela.
“I am the Caribou-Footed. Can you tell me
who lives over there in that big white wigwam?”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Capoteka—for that was the
old woman’s name—“I know you, Ithenthiela!
Long have I known that sometime
you would come here. But you have done
wrong; this is no country for man. In that
great wigwam over there lives Itakempka;
and he is unhappy because he has lost his
great medicine belt. Until he gets it again,
no one will be happy in the Sky Country.
The belt is at the tepee of the two blind
women who live far beyond the wigwam
which shines so white, and no one has been
able to get it from them. But whoever captures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
it, and takes it from the blind women,
will have the daughter of Itakempka, the
beautiful Etanda, for his wife.”</p>

<p>At these words off started Ithenthiela, and,
traveling hard, he soon came to a tepee which
stood alone; the home of the two old blind
women.</p>

<p>Dull and gloomy was the covering of the
wigwam; but from the tiny hole in the smoke-begrimed
moose skins came a strange, bright
light at which Ithenthiela marveled.</p>

<p>But when he entered he saw what it was
that gave the mysterious light. It came from
the great medicine belt which hung upon the
wall, and surrounding the belt were the skulls
of many men.</p>

<p>The belt was studded with gems. From
great rubies sparkled the rays of crimson;
from huge amethysts shone streams of purple;
from mighty sapphires came the deepest
blue, and gorgeous emeralds shot rays of
green; while great cairngorms scintillated
with yellow glow. The lights changed from
blood-red to purple, from purple to blue, from
blue to green, from green to yellow, and ever
and anon faded altogether, to be succeeded by
the mixed rainbow of color from fair opals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
or by the pure white light of great diamonds.
This was the magic belt of Itakempka.</p>

<p>The blind women bade Ithenthiela welcome
and said to him:</p>

<p>“Tell us, Ithenthiela, when you are about
to leave, so that we may bid you good-by.”</p>

<p>Now, Ithenthiela had noticed that each of
the old women had behind her back a knife of
copper, long and sharp and gleaming; and
that one sat on either side of the door, waiting.</p>

<p>“Ah!” thought he, “when I leave they
mean to kill me. But, I shall fool them.”</p>

<p>In one part of the wigwam lay a muskamoot,
or bag, of bones and feathers. To this
he tied a string, which he pulled over the
pole above the door. Then, said he:</p>

<p>“I am going now, Blind Women. Remember
that I am old and fat, and when I leave I
make much noise.”</p>

<p>With this he pulled the string, whereat the
bag of bones and feathers trundled toward
the door. Immediately the two old hags
stabbed; but striking only feathers, the long
knife of each passed through the bag into
the body of the other, and both were killed.</p>

<p>Then Ithenthiela took the precious belt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
and hastened with all speed toward the wigwam
of Itakempka. As he neared the great
Chief’s home he heard no sound of man or
beast. Entering, he saw that all the camp
was sleeping. Around the long-cold fire lay
the warriors and maidens, the old men and
women, and in their midst the tall Chief,
decked with faded plumes.</p>

<p>Then for the first time, Ithenthiela drew
from beneath his leathern shirt the belt of
medicine. Around the wigwam flashed the
rays of red, purple, green, and gold. Instantly
the warriors and maidens, the old men
and women, awoke. Up rose the Chief, fine
and stately among them, as the color came
back to his gorgeous head-dress, and as the
fire on the hearth sparkled into life.</p>

<p>Then said Ithenthiela: “Great Chief, be
you happy now. I have brought you back
your healing belt, the band of life, of hope,
of war, and of peace. Henceforth it shall
abide here in its true place with you.”</p>

<p>Then said Itakempka: “Greatly I rejoice,
O Ithenthiela! You have saved my people.
Now shall the sun shine again. Now shall
musk-oxen, caribou, moose, and bears live
once more in our country. Again shall we see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
the smoke of many wigwams. Once more shall
we hear the voice of many hunters, and ever
and anon the war-whoop of the warriors.
You have wakened us from our long winter
sleep. Take you now my daughter, the fair
Etanda, for your wife. But leave me not.
You shall stay with me, and be a great chief
after me.” So Ithenthiela remained in the
shining white home of Itakempka.</p>

<p>And still the Red Children in the distant
northern lands tell of Ithenthiela when the
northern lights flit across the sky.</p>

<p>“Ah!” they cry, with their faces bowed
before that splendid light, which is to them
the most mysterious thing of nature. “See
the fingers of Ithenthiela are beckoning us
to the home which he found for us beyond
the sky.”</p>

</div>

<p>The world is a wonder-palace to the child.
“Everything hints at something more
magical and more marvelous which is to
come.” The inanimate objects about him are
given living attributes; animals and flowers
are endowed by his fancy with human
thought and feeling. He talks to the clouds
and the stars; he peoples the sky with living
inhabitants; to him the winds are not
“forces of nature”; they are boisterous companions
or gentle friends.</p>

<p>This applies to the imaginative child, and
there are more imaginative children than the
most of us suspect. The imagination may
be suppressed by older and “wiser” companions,
or natural shyness may cause the
imaginative fancies to remain unvoiced; but
the fancies are there—bubbling over in fantastic
follies or childish imagery, or kept in
those hidden chambers of the soul to which
grown-ups are forbidden entrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>Because of this mental attitude, children
are inherent myth-makers. And to the same
mental attitude upon the part of the children
of the race, is due the fund of mythological
lore which has enriched the world’s literature
and inspired much of its art.</p>

<p>To this rich store, then, the child may be
introduced by means of mythological stories.
Their appeal is strong because they are in
harmony with his own spontaneous interests.
Froebel says: “Would’st thou know how to
teach the child? Observe him, and he will
show you what to do.” If, then, the child so
loves the myth, let us hold him and help him
by means of the mythological story. Those
which contain an objectionable element may
readily be withheld; there are plenty which
are beautiful in their form and true in their
teaching.</p>

<p>The myth, strictly speaking, differs from
the fairy story in that it personifies the forces
and manifestations of nature: Aurora awakening
the sleeping world with her shafts of
light; Ceres presiding over the harvests of
golden grain; Jove hurling the dreadful thunderbolts;
and Narcissus living in the beautiful
blossom which bears his name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>Few children will accept these stories as
absolute statements of fact, nor need they be
so presented. Whatever this personification
of the universal elements may have meant to
the ancient Greeks, to us it is purely imaginary;
it is the fairy-land of nature. Children
love to “make believe,” and their own
personifications of the forces of nature,
while spontaneous and vivid, are a part of
their imaginative world—a part of their
“make believe.” So, mythological stories are
never accepted by them upon the literal plane
of the true nature story, nor should they ever
be so presented. When stories of the ancient
gods and goddesses are told, they may be
very briefly outlined as the imaginative stories
of an ancient race. This will give them
their true place, without in the least detracting
from their charm.</p>

<p>The child who is made familiar with the old
mythology by means of stories and verse,
holds the key of understanding to the countless
allusions of the world’s best literature.
He may not comprehend the deeper meaning,
nor understand that they were the religion of
an ancient people, but when in his later reading
of some masterpiece of poetry or prose he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
finds an allusion to Phaeton, to Apollo, or to
Neptune, he will experience the same delight
that comes to one who meets an old playfellow
in a foreign land.</p>

<h4><i>The Hero-Tale</i></h4>

<p>As the child creates a world of fancy and,
when left to himself, lives within it, so marvelous
deeds and achievements are to him as
the daily breath of our own lives. He imagines
himself the hero of such wonderful
and impossible adventures that when he is
told of Phaeton and his mad ride, he accepts
it with the same calm appreciation
which is accorded the imaginings of his own
creative moods. The slaying of the Gorgon
is fully in harmony with his own future plans.
Not that he believes in these hero tales literally,
or comprehends their deeper significance,
but they fit in so perfectly with his
normal habit of creative fancy that they seem
to him as his very own, and he loves them.</p>

<p>The hero-tale appeals as strongly to the
child as does the myth—probably more
strongly to the boy. Indeed, the myth and
hero-tale are often one, for Greek and Norse
mythology abound in heroes and heroic adventures,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
and the lad who pores breathlessly
over the thrilling experiences of a Captain
Kidd, would find equal delight in the story
of the Wooden Horse and the Fall of Troy,
were it told him in a manner suited to his
age and understanding.</p>

<p>The story of Arion, returning victorious
from the great musical contest, and threatened
by the mutinous seamen of his vessel,
stirs any boy to enthusiasm, as do the adventures
of Perseus, who, helped by Minerva
and Mercury, slew the Gorgon, Medusa.</p>

<p>In another field there are the merry tales
of Robin Hood, the outlaw beloved of boys,
with his host of adventurous followers; and
the chivalrous deeds of King Arthur and his
Knights of the Round Table. Stories of the
knights appeal to universal boyhood. Well
do I remember a story hour in which the compact
body of the audience was fringed all
about with boys under whose arms were shoe-blacking
kits, or bundles of newspapers.
They dodged in for a story, and out again
for a customer, but with one voice they demanded—it
was not a request—“Give us a
knight story! Give us a knight story!”</p>

<p>Boys can be kept from reading worthless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
fiction if books and stories of the right sort
are placed in their hands, and the surest
way to make these attractive is to give them
the contents or a part of the contents in story
form first. Make the stories vivid, give them
plenty of life and action, and Captain Kidd
or Bunco Bill will pale before King Arthur
and Ulysses.</p>

<p>The younger children will listen with greatest
delight to stories of imaginary heroes,
such as abound in folk-lore and myth—Jack
the Giant Killer easily leading in favor, as
has been proven by statistics.</p>

<p>Children demand definite aims, swift action,
prompt reward of the good, and punishment
of the evil. They do not understand
complex motives nor the slow working out of
nature’s retribution. This comes with later
years. The story-teller must choose her subjects
in accordance with the age of the child.
The world of fancy gradually gives way before
the world of fact, and there comes a
time when the heroes of the myth and the
fairy tale are received with a certain degree
of scorn. They are “out-grown.” At this
period the boy and girl demand heroes of
flesh and blood; men who “do and dare”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
especially appeal to them. There must still
be rapid action and swift retribution or reward,
but motives begin to be understood
more fully, and little by little these motives
begin to be less self-centered; they touch an
ever-broadening circle.</p>

<p>To follow this circle and select stories
which fit its circumference should be the aim
of mother and teacher. Here, as everywhere
in teaching, the “spontaneous interests”
furnish the key for selection.</p>

<p>The range of hero-tales is wide. Among
them are the mythological and folk-lore tales
previously suggested; the legendary hero-tales
which are partly fact and partly fancy,
such as the <i>Knights of the Round Table</i>,
<i>Robin Hood</i>, and most of the medieval stories;
and Bible stories, among which there
are a host of heroic characters, whose
<i>moral</i> heroism should be made the dominant
note.</p>

<p>There are also the heroes who have traveled,
explored, and dared in the interests of
science, and those who have endured hardship
and privation in order to carry civilization
to the dark corners of the globe. There
are heroes also, often unknown, who risk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
their lives almost daily to carry on the mechanical
processes of modern civilization.
Any of these will form the nucleus of stories
of thrilling interest to the growing boy
and girl. Let the motive for the heroic deed
be felt throughout the story. Do not tack
it on as a moral; let it permeate the whole
narrative. It has been truly said that “To
add a moral application to a story is as complete
a confession of failure as to append an
explanation to a joke.”</p>

<p>The material for hero-tales lies all about
us—upon the pages of the newspaper and
the magazine, as well as between the covers
of the Iliad and the Odyssey.</p>

<p>Give the boy and girl stories “clean in
the warp and woof”; stories of brave, noble
men and women, worthy of emulation, for
“with the great, one’s thoughts and manners
easily become great.”</p>

<p>The following story of “The Coming of
Arthur” from <i>Some Great Stories and How
to Tell Them</i> (Newson and Company), by
Richard Thomas Wyche, founder of The
Story-Tellers’ League, is one of the best examples
known to the author of the sort of
hero or knight story which all boys love, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
which will lead them into the realms of the
best and purest literature.</p>

<h4>The Coming of Arthur<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h4>

<p>One dark stormy night a long time ago, in
a land beyond the seas, old King Uther lay
upon his bed dying. He was weeping and
lamenting, not so much because he was leaving
this world, as because he had no son or
daughter to come after him and rule England.
There were two old men who stood near the
king, whose names were Bleys and Merlin.
When they saw that their king was silent in
death, they passed out into the black night
and walked down toward the ocean where the
great waves came rolling in from the deep.</p>

<p>The night was stormy, and they noticed
that the waves grew larger and larger. They
counted them—one, two, three, up to the
ninth—which seemed to gather half the sea.
Suddenly, on the highest crest of this wave,
they saw a shining ship in the form of a dragon,
and all from stem to stern the deck was
covered with shining people. No sooner had
they seen the ship than it disappeared. But
nevertheless this great wave came rolling in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
and tumbled at their feet. Strange to say
out of this wave there rolled a little naked
child, and Merlin picked it up and cried,
“The King! The King! An heir for Uther!”
Then the long wave swept up the beach,
wrapped about the old man and flashed like
fire. After which there was a calm, and the
stars came out, and the elves and fairies blew
their horns from cliff to cliff.</p>

<p>Merlin gave the little child to an old woman
to nurse. He was given the name of Arthur,
and as the years passed by he grew into a
beautiful boy with blue eyes and golden hair.
Merlin, who was a very wise old man, became
the boy’s teacher.</p>

<p>But let me tell you a story about the boy.
One day, as Arthur was walking out all alone
in the sunny fields, he came upon a little girl
sitting upon a bank of heath, weeping as if
her heart would break, and saying: “I hate
this fair world and all that’s in it.” She had
been beaten for a fault of which she was not
guilty. When she looked up there stood the
boy, Arthur. Whether he could walk unseen
like his old teacher Merlin, who was something
of a wizard, she did not know, but there
he stood smiling at her. He dried her tears,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
comforted her heart, and was a child with
her. But one day after that when she saw
him again he was so dignified and cold she
was afraid of him. But again when she saw
him his ways were sweet and they played as
children together. They were golden hours
for her and for him. She said then, “Some
day he will be King.”</p>

<p>As Arthur grew into manhood he wanted
a sword, as all boys did in those days. One
summer day he was in his boat on the lake.
All around him spread the shining water,
above him bent the sky, soft and blue. He
moved to the center of the lake and stopped.
It was noon, and he sat thinking. Perhaps
he was wondering what he would do when
he became a man. Suddenly he heard the
water ripple, and near by he saw, rising from
the lake a white arm and hand holding a
sword. Arthur reached out and took the
sword and then the hand disappeared.</p>

<p>The hilt of the sword was in the shape of
a cross, studded with jewels that sparkled
and flashed. He pulled it from the scabbard
and the blade was so bright that it hurt his
eye to look at it. On one side of the blade
he saw cut in the steel in the oldest language<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
of all the world, the words, “Take me,” but
on the other side, in the language of the
people, “Cast me away.” It made him sad
to think he must cast it away. He took it to
his old teacher Merlin, who was then a hundred
winters old. Merlin said: “‘Take me’
means that you must take the sword, clear
the forest, let in the light and make broad
pathways for the hunter and the knight;
break up the robber bands and bandit holds;
drive back the heathen that come swarming
over the seas, burning the houses and killing
the people.” Then he whispered into
Arthur’s ear and said: “Some day you may
be king. After you have ruled the land and
made it better, the time will come when you
may cast the sword away, but that is a long
way off.”</p>

<p>The years passed. Not since the dark
stormy night on which King Uther died had
there been a strong ruler in England. The
people fought among themselves. The
heathen came swarming over the seas; the
wild animals came from the woods and carried
off the children. The land was going to
ruin. One day the people came together and
said: “We must make one man king.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
Whom do you suppose they crowned? Merlin,
with his knowledge and power, had
Arthur lifted up and put on the throne. Many
believed he was the rightful king, but others
said: “Away with him, he is no king of
ours, he is base-born.” But then Arthur
spoke to the people in the hall, and asked all
the young men who would help him rule the
land to come forward. Many heard his manly
voice and came and stood before him. He said
to them: “Will you speak the truth; be
pure; right the wrong; be strong, yet gentle;
be true in love; obey the king and your
conscience?” When they said “yes,” they
kneeled before him, and he made them his
knights. When they arose from the knighting,
he spoke to them in a low deep voice of
authority and told them that he wished to
make a good king, and that he wanted them
to rule the land and make the world better,
and the people happier.</p>

<p>While he stood speaking to them, for a moment
every man seemed to favor the king;
their faces were radiant. Then suddenly
three rays of light fell as if from heaven,
and lit up the faces of three tall queens,
who stood near the throne to help the king<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
at his need. Near him stood his old teacher
Merlin, and the Lady of the Lake who, it
was said, made and gave him Excalibur, the
wonderful sword. After that, other young
men came and took the vows of knighthood,
until there were hundreds of knights. They
were called Knights of the Round Table.</p>

<p>Then King Arthur went against the
heathen, and in twelve great battles drove
the last one from the country. One day, as
he was passing with his army through the
streets of a village, he saw, standing by a
castle wall, a beautiful young woman. He
did not know her, nor did she know him; for
Arthur was clad simply as one of his knights,
and not in his kingly robes. Arthur could
not forget the face. He was in love with the
young woman, and wanted to make her his
wife and queen. When he returned to his
palace, he called Sir Bedivere and two other
knights, and sent them to search for the
young woman.</p>

<p>The young woman’s name was Guinevere,
called the pearl of beauty, and her father was
an old king, Leodogran, King of Camelaird.
When the knights stood before him, and said,
“King Arthur wishes Guinevere to be his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
wife and queen,” the old man spoke roughly
to them, and said, “Who is Arthur, that I
should give my daughter in marriage to him?
He is base-born, and not the son of a king.
Even though he has helped me in battle, how
can I, being a king, give my daughter in
marriage to a man that is not a king, or the
son of a king?”</p>

<p>When Leodogran was persuaded to make
further inquiries, and heard of Arthur’s
birth and boyhood, of the wonderful sword
Excalibur, of the three rays of light at his
coronation, and of his pure life and great
deeds, he still doubted.</p>

<p>He sat upon his seat and actually nodded,
napped, and kept the knights waiting. But
while he napped, he dreamed, and in his dream
saw a great battlefield starting at his feet
and sloping away as far as the eye could
reach. On this field armies were passing and
moving. Arthur, the newly crowned king,
with his army, was victorious and glorious.
When Leodogran woke up, he called the
knights and said: “Yes, Guinevere, my
daughter, may go.”</p>

<p>Some time after that, King Arthur called
Sir Lancelot, his best knight and warrior,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
and sent him to bring the Queen-to-be to his
palace. Sir Lancelot and the other knights
with him rode away on horseback, while King
Arthur stood and watched them from the
gates as they disappeared. Guinevere was
ready and came with Sir Lancelot. It was
the first of May, when the earth was white
with hyacinths. The woods were all abloom
and seemed full of singing birds. Guinevere
rode on horseback by Sir Lancelot. Each
day couriers went before and pitched a tent
where the Queen-to-be might rest at noon.
The journey was soon at an end. Sir Lancelot
had entertained Guinevere with talk of
the tourney, the chase, the hunt, and of King
Arthur and his noble deeds. Sir Lancelot
was so strong, yet gentle and tender, that
she could not help but like him, and love him.
When King Arthur came out to meet her, clad
in his kingly robes, he seemed so tall and dignified
that she felt a little afraid of him. But
she knew that she was to be his wife and
queen. Straightway they went to the church,
and there before the highest of altar shrines,
the bishop made them man and wife, and
blessed them. Then as they went from the
church King Arthur’s Knights, clad in stainless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
white, marched before him with trumpets
and a song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Blow trumpet, for the world is white with May!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blow trumpet, the long night hath rolled away!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blow thro’ the living world, “Let the King reign!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And that was the coming of King Arthur.</p>

<span class="smaller">Holiday and Vacation Stories</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Stories fitted to the holiday seasons, and
the out-door stories of vacation time are
always a source of delight to both story-teller
and listeners. Each holiday has its
quota of timely stories; and by no other
means can the spirit and the lesson of a special
day or season be more vividly impressed
upon a child’s mind than by a well-chosen,
well-told story. Many mothers and teachers
understand this, and a still larger number
would find undreamed-of pleasure and
resultant good in a practical test of the statement.</p>

<p>The spirit of Thanksgiving may be made
active in the child and a lasting impetus for
good imparted through stories which are
strong, and full of the Thanksgiving atmosphere.</p>

<p>The same is true of stories pertaining to
Christmas, to New Year’s, to Washington’s
and Lincoln’s Birthdays, to Memorial Day,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
and to all other days that are generally
observed, and whose lessons teachers are
expected to impress.</p>

<p>In making up special day programs, if
teachers will devote one number to a good,
strong story, appropriate to the occasion,
it will prove not only one of the most interesting
features of the day, but the one which
will make the most lasting impression. This
applies to the higher grades even more emphatically
than to the lower grades where
stories are more frequently told, and are, in
consequence, less of a treat and an innovation.</p>

<h4><i>Vacation Stories</i></h4>

<p>After the first few blissful days of vacation
idleness, children of school age begin
to grow restless, and are ready for occupation
or entertainment. This natural desire opens
up a useful and delightful occupation for
teachers, or for others who are interested
in children and capable of telling them stories
in a fascinating way. This consists of
a series of “story hours in the open” which
may be arranged for the summer months.
The work should be planned systematically,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
with a definite object in view for each series,
and with special regard to grouping children
of the same approximate age.</p>

<p>One series may be made up of stories of
out-door mythology, or fairy tales dealing
with out-door life. They may be told upon
a lawn or in some park, with the children
seated upon the grass in informal groups,
and the story-teller in their midst. The out-door
environment will give the children a
sense of participation in the events of the
story which cannot be gained within four
walls.</p>

<p>A park or a bit of natural woods makes
an ideal setting for a series of Robin Hood
tales, or for tales of chivalry. The boys
and girls will people the woods about them
with the characters of the story, and the tales
they hear under such conditions will not be
easily effaced.</p>

<p>Excursions to parks, or near-by lakes, or
woods, seem an almost necessary accompaniment
to stories of the trees, the birds, the
wild life of the floral and the animal world.
Material for such stories is abundant. There
are the works of John Burroughs, Olive
Thorne Miller, Dr. Long, Kipling, Thompson-Seton,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
and Charles G. D. Roberts, with a
host of others which any library or book store
can furnish.</p>

<p>Boys and girls will show a vital interest in
stories of local history, if the stories are not
thus labeled.</p>

<p>The early history of the region in which
they live, the struggles, experiences, and adventures
of the early explorers of the territory
surrounding their own home, may be
made intensely interesting; and if the group
of listeners can be taken to the spot which
forms the setting of the story, the bit of
history becomes most vital and real.</p>

<p>This plan of out-door story-telling combines
the benefits of the usual vacation activities
with the legitimate good of the story
hour as conducted in our libraries during the
winter months.</p>

<p>Stories of industry, and of the development
of a given line of commerce or manufacture
are full of interest for boys especially. These
may be told in connection with the leading
business interests of the city or community
in which the stories are given.</p>

<p>Every state, every city, affords story material
which may be so cast as to rival the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
wonders of Aladdin’s lamp. These stories
are not, as a rule, ready-made. They require
study, research, preparation, but the warp
and the woof are there, ready at hand in the
records which any state or city library holds,
and it remains for the story-teller so to weave
the fabric of her story that it shall attract
the fancy and stir the imagination. It need
not be a literary masterpiece, but it must
have life and action; it must tell of difficulties
overcome, with a triumphant ending of final
achievement.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">Bible Stories</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Of all the stories that we may tell our
children, first in importance are the
stories of the Bible. During the early years,
when the most lasting impressions are made,
when faith is simple, when the thought of
God’s presence and love is natural, the Bible
stories should be told over and over again.</p>

<p>There should be no attempt at this time to
interpret the stories or to bring out theological
questions. The stories should be told
in all their original simplicity, using as far
as possible the Bible language, which is brief,
strong, picturesque. No possible improvement
could be made over the wording of the
Creation Story as told in the first chapter
of Genesis and the first three verses of the
second chapter. The children will not tire
of its telling, and it should become as familiar
to them as are their nursery rhymes.
The shame is upon us as fathers and mothers
that this is so seldom the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>The story of the flood, divided into its four
parts, as given in the collected stories of
this book, should be made equally familiar
to the children. A comparison of these stories
with the Bible narrative will show that
the original language has been retained, and
only such detail and repetition as would confuse
the little child, have been omitted. The
literary style is unchanged.</p>

<p>In these stories there is all the charm of
the folk-tale with its simple directness of
style, its rapid action, its repetition of words
and phrases, such as “every living thing, of
fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping
thing,” yet it is lifted far above the folk-tale
by the all-pervading thought of God acting
in righteousness.</p>

<p>No Bible story is worthily told which does
not touch the underlying truth of the beauty
of holiness, and the folly and inevitable consequences
of sin. In preparing Bible stories
for telling, the story-teller should have always
in mind what has been called the “basic
principle of both Old and New Testaments”—the
perfect God desiring to restore man
“to holiness and true communion with Himself.”
But this truth should be inherent in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
the story, and not presented in the form of an
appended moral.</p>

<p>As to the manner of telling: a Bible story
should be narrated with the spontaneous life
that is accorded the telling of any other story.
Too often, through an effort upon the part
of the conscientious story-teller to impress
their religious nature, to communicate to the
child a feeling of awe, the Bible stories are
told in a truly <i>awful</i> manner, and the child,
without knowing why, learns to dread them.
They have been made to him something unreal,
something which he cannot understand,
which he fears. This is the last result that
the story-teller has desired, but it is the inevitable
result when sanctimoniousness is
substituted for the “love, joy, and gentleness”
which are among the fruits of the
Spirit, and which must fashion the telling
of the Bible stories.</p>

<p>Rightly told, the Bible stories arouse in
the child the keenest interest and the deepest
pleasure. What child, after hearing the
story of Joseph—the child who dreamed
dreams and who wore the marvelous coat of
many colors—being sold into bondage to the
Midianites by his brethren, will not want to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
hear “what happened next?” And what
story is more beautiful, more filled with wonders
and marvels, with love, and forgiveness,
and moral steadfastness, than the story of
Joseph? It is quite as fascinating as any
tale from the Arabian Nights, and it excels
the latter a thousand-fold in its fundamental
value, for these Old Testament stories
eclipse the myth and the hero-tale not only
in their genuine interest for the child, but because
they bring him into conscious relationship
with God—the God of Abraham,
and Isaac, and Jacob; the God whose throne
is for ever and ever, and the sceptre of whose
kingdom is the sceptre of <i>righteousness</i>.</p>

<p>It is possible here to give only the briefest
outline of the various kinds of stories which
one may choose from this wealth of material.
There are the wonder stories of the creation,
the Garden of Eden, the flood, in the first
part of the book of Genesis; the patriarch
stories of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and
Joseph, in the latter part of the same book;
the story of Moses, and all the wonders of
the Exodus; the stories of the prophets, of
Joshua, Samuel, Daniel; the hero-stories of
Samson, of David’s encounter with Goliath;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
of Gideon; the pastoral story of Ruth. In
the New Testament are the stories of Christ’s
birth, His life, with all its boyhood incidents,
its parables, and its wonders, closing with
His death and resurrection. The question
is not, “What can I tell?” but, “Which shall
I tell?” The fund is practically inexhaustible.</p>

<p>I have a word of caution to offer to the
one—be she mother, Sunday School teacher,
or story-teller, who presents Bible stories to
children: put nothing into the stories by
way of explanation which the Bible does not
put there, and which will have to be recalled
or modified when the child grows older and
begins to ask questions, and to this end do
not make the mistake of confounding the
truth taught, with the literal form of its
teaching.</p>

<p>As the child grows older and begins to
analyze, to reason, and to ask questions, then
must the story-teller—and let us hope that
the chief Bible story-teller may be the
mother—be ready to guide surely and unfold
wisely the deeper and higher meaning
of the stories of the Book of Books.</p>

<span class="smaller">Systematic Story-Telling</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The thought that literature is a growth;
that it had its infancy, and its periods
of development through succeeding ages;
that the different periods are related to each
other and spring from one another, is too
often ignored in the study and in the teaching
of the subject.</p>

<p>Not only the average child, but the great
majority of children—if not of adults—look
upon literature as a great heap of miscellany;
a vast array of unrelated writings. Few
grasp the idea that “literature is the evolution
of the thought of humanity”; that it
had its beginning in the myth-making ages,
was further developed by the Greeks and
then by the Latin races; that after the time
of Christ there was the distinctive literature
of the chivalric period, followed by the development
of Chaucer’s time, of Shakespeare’s,
up to and including that of the present
age. Each of these periods has its many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
subdivisions, but each is the outgrowth of the
preceding.</p>

<p>The story-teller who has grasped even the
simplest outlines of literary development will
be able to present to the children a sequence
of stories which shall, dimly at first, but more
and more clearly as time goes on, enable them
to look at the literature of the world as a
related whole. This is, of course, the privilege
only of the mother, or of the teacher who
is in daily contact with the same pupils for
an extended length of time. It cannot be
done by the occasional story-teller.</p>

<p>As ocular demonstration produces the most
lasting impression, the best method of fixing
this idea of development is by means of
diagrams made up in the simplest manner
possible. If no blackboard is available, a
paper chain will answer the purpose, its few,
large links representing the literary periods.
Suggestions for diagrams or charts suited
to all grades, and to children of all ages, are
given in Miss M. E. Burt’s concise but
comprehensive book <i>Literary Landmarks</i>
(Houghton, Mifflin Company)—a book which
every teacher should read.</p>

<p>The simplest chart of all consists of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
straight line drawn horizontally, in the middle
of which is a cross, representing the time
of Christ. The portion of the line to the left
indicates the time before Christ; that to the
right, the time since Christ. Present day
stories may be shown as belonging to the
right hand portion of the chart, New Testament
stories to the middle portion, and the
myth to the left hand. A very few words
of explanation will suffice to make plain the
meaning of the chart as giving the relative
time of the story’s origin. Then proceed to
tell the story as usual.</p>

<p>The first story in a series planned along
these lines, may well be one of the earliest
myths, that of Phaeton, or of Vulcan, illustrating
the earliest conception of the phenomenon
of light and of fire. The Indian
myth, giving the origin of fire as conceived
by the North American Indian, should also
be told, and located on the right hand side of
the chart.</p>

<p>The story of Cupid can be traced from
its origin in the old time myth, through Greek
literature and on into modern poems and
prose, thus showing how the original thought
of the myth-making period grows into new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
forms and new beauty in the literature of
later periods.</p>

<p>Miss Burt sets forth clearly the use of
the diagram or chart in the teaching of literature.
It can be used with equal success and
to as great advantage by the story-teller who
gives a related series of stories from different
periods of time. Grade teachers can
make the chart serve its original purpose in
the teaching of literature, and in story-telling
can place the story in a brief word or two
which shall give it a place, or a relationship
to literature. This makes the story of
greater value, through helping the child to
assemble his literary landmarks.</p>

<p>The mother who follows this method of
story-telling in the home, selecting her stories
from the best that literature affords, and
grouping or placing them according to the
period to which each belongs, will find as
great delight and profit in the task, as will
the children in the stories themselves. To
many a mother, and teacher as well, it will
prove a new viewpoint from which to study
literature, while meeting the child’s desire
for stories in more than aimless fashion.</p>

<p>The historical outline of a nation’s progress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
can be given by means of stories told in
sequence. These stories should follow a
chronological plan which can be as readily developed
by means of a chart as can the periods
of literature. The outline should be a
very simple one at first, dividing the history
into a few main periods of development, and
telling stories characteristic of the divisions
of time. Later these main periods may be
subdivided, and new stories told of prominent
characters or events, until a fairly comprehensive
view of the history as a whole has
been acquired.</p>

<p>Mothers who fear that the home duties and
the rearing of children will cause them to
drop behind the times, or to become out of
date in their mental equipment, need have no
fear of the children outstripping them if they
will prepare themselves with a good outline
of literature and of history, and follow these
in the stories they tell their children. Such
outlines may be found at any good library.</p>

<p>Mythology and chivalry may be knitted
into the hose and mittens of the little people;
fairy tales may be hemmed into the dainty
garments; and deeds of heroism mixed with
the custard and the rolls, thus clothing and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
building up discriminating minds to fit strong
and rugged bodies.</p>

<p>To mothers, as to teachers, I would most
heartily recommend Miss Burt’s book already
mentioned, for it is full of suggestive
outlines which may be simplified or modified
to meet any existing need, while it gives
a wide range of books from which stories
may be chosen to fill the outlines.</p>

<p>Another source of help to which too few
mothers have recourse is to be found in the
modern “children’s librarian.” Since story-telling
has been made so important a feature
of library work in the children’s department,
the subject has been given close
study, lists have been compiled, and special
outlines prepared. Librarians are eager to
extend these helps to mothers who may thus
be saved the time which would otherwise be
required for individual research.</p>

<span class="smaller">The Joy of Story-Telling</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Did you ever drop down upon a somewhat
sleepy village where recreations and
amusements are almost unknown, and there
gather the children together and give them
a story hour?</p>

<p>They come with wonder, even with suspicion
that you have some ulterior object as
yet undisclosed, and they file in and eye you
askance.</p>

<p>And then you begin to tell the stories—animal
stories, for all children love those;
a story from the Bible which reveals to them
the fact that there are as great heroes among
the Bible characters as are to be found in
secular history; a tale of chivalry which stirs
the boys; and then perhaps a dialect story
from Uncle Remus;—and as you tell the stories
the suspicious look vanishes; the clear
eyes before you look straight into yours;
then there creeps into them a brightness, an
eagerness for more; then comes the ripple of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
merriment; a spontaneous ring of laughter;
and then the plea, “One more, oh, please,
<i>one more</i>!”</p>

<p>When you have done this; when you have
won to you the shy children of a whole village,
then you know the pure joy of story-telling.</p>

<p>There is nothing better worth winning than
the love of a child, and there is no surer way
of reaching a child’s heart than through the
story.</p>

<h4><i>The Story Hour</i></h4>

<p>Story-telling may be made a serious matter
as to its purpose, but it should never be a
serious matter as to its presentation. Whatever
its purpose, the story itself must be a
source of joy to the hearer, or its purpose
fails. The lesson to be taught, whether moral
or educational, fails in its object if the story
itself be irksome or stupid.</p>

<p>Conscientious teachers, feeling the weight
of argument against them, and taking up the
<i>task</i> of story-telling as an added obligation
of schoolroom duty, wonder why the results
are not what the evidence of other story-tellers
had led them to believe. Story-telling,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
as a duty, unlightened and unbrightened by
a genuine love of the story and an eagerness
for the joy it is to bring to the listeners, can
never prove a success.</p>

<p>The story-teller must enter with all her
heart and all her enthusiasm into the life
and beauty of the story she is telling, in
order to achieve the best results. Without
this she cannot win the response of her hearers,
nor reap the reward which should be
her own.</p>

<p>It is in the story hour that the true story-teller
comes into her kingdom. Here she is
free to give to the expectant hearers just
the tale which they love to hear. She is not
bound by rules or regulations, by systems or
courses, but may follow the promptings of
her intuition and sway her small auditors
at her will.</p>

<p>Here the rig-ma-role story may find its
proper place and delight by its whimsical
nonsense; the tale of chivalry, the story of
brave achievement, or of loyalty of purpose,
may be made to stir her hearers; the dialect
story—which the children seldom read but
love to hear—may lend its quaint charm;
or the nonsense tale may be used as the safety<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
valve for bubbling emotions. Varied in character
as the stories may be, each is permeated
by the truest, purest joy in the telling—be
it the classical story of the “Wooden Horse”
and the “Fall of Troy,” or the nursery tale
of the “Little Small Rid Hin” and the
fall of “Reynard the Fox.”</p>

<p>Thus may we win the hearts and the confidence
of the children, and having won these,
we may lead them whithersoever we will.
And so, with Kate Douglas Wiggin, I can
truly say: “I would rather be the children’s
story-teller than the queen’s favorite
or the king’s counsellor.”</p>

<span class="smaller">Story-Telling as an Art</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The artist in colors works out his conception
of a picture upon canvas. It is finished,
and he steps aside. Personally he has
nothing further to do with the presentation of
that picture. But if his own individuality has
not entered into the work, if something of
himself has not permeated it, it can never be
a work of true art.</p>

<p>The story-teller also presents a picture—a
word picture—and, like that of the artist
of the brush, if her own individuality has not
entered into it, if something of herself has
not permeated it, it can not be true art. But,
unlike the painter, her picture is never completed;
she is never able to step aside and
say, “It is finished.” And here the story-teller
has the advantage of the painter, for
each re-telling of her story is a new presentation,
and in each re-telling her own personality
may lend a deeper pathos, a rarer glint
of humor, a more searching vision of truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>The story itself is the picture; its theme
forms the subject; its literary quality corresponds
to canvas and color. Hence a story,
to be artistically told, must be well chosen.
In its inherent character it must awaken the
imagination; it must satisfy the love of
beauty; it must mirror truth; and it must
appeal to both the intellect and the emotion.</p>

<p>Art’s chief charm lies in its power to
awaken the imagination, to stir the fancy, to
suggest something above and beyond the
actual portrayal. The subject of artistic
story-telling must always be beautiful, but
there are many types of beauty, many forms
and fancies which appeal to our aesthetic
sense. Again, no story which is not painted
against “a universal background of truth”
can be artistic, for truth, not error, is beautiful.
Finally, a story, to be great, must of
necessity appeal to the intellect; but if its
appeal be to the intellect alone, it is cold and
formal. It must touch the emotions as well:
it must have a human interest.</p>

<p>Every well-told story, as every gem from
the artist’s brush, must have atmosphere—that
indefinable something which casts its
glamour over the whole. In story-telling, this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
sense of atmosphere must come from the personality
of the teller. That is why there is
such a variety of charm in hearing the same
story told by different persons. This sense
of atmosphere is created by the story-teller’s
losing herself wholly in the story. She completely
absorbs the story, its setting, its characters,
its ideals, and when she gives it forth
again, it takes op something of herself. This
cannot be the case if the story is told as something
assumed, external, or borrowed. In the
latter, no matter how good the technique, the
art is lost. Perhaps this point, which is most
essential to artistic story-telling, may be more
deeply impressed by a concrete example:</p>

<p>The story-lovers of one of our large cities
recently had the pleasure of listening to two
well-known story-tellers, each giving an hour
with Uncle Remus. Only a few days elapsed
between the two presentations. In the first
instance the story-teller had scarcely more
than commenced when we felt that we were
sitting in Uncle Remus’ cabin, away down
South, listening to the adventures of Brer
Wolf, Brer Fox, and Brer Rabbit, told by the
old man who loved them as his own brothers
of the woods. <i>We were</i> the little boy, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
whom Uncle Remus was telling the stories in
his own inimitable way.</p>

<p>In the second instance we were an audience
in the North, listening to a well-told—a thoroughly
well-told—account of Uncle Remus’
telling to a little boy the adventures of Brer
Wolf, Brer Fox, and Brer Rabbit. We
laughed with the little boy; we enjoyed it
with the little boy, but we ourselves were not
that little boy sitting at the feet of Uncle
Remus.</p>

<p>Do you see the contrast? The first story-teller
created the true “Uncle Remus atmosphere”;
his story-telling was an art.</p>

<p>What was the difference in the telling? It
was very simple. The one became Uncle
Remus in spirit. In all conscious simplicity
he <i>was</i> the old colored story-teller whom Joel
Chandler Harris created, and he was telling
his story to the little boy—not to an
“audience.” The other told us—most
delightfully—<i>about</i> the old colored story-teller,
and reproduced for us his stories. His
technique was above reproach, and he satisfied
the intellect. The first also satisfied the
intellect, but he reached far beyond it and
touched the heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>The artistic story must have perspective.
One which lacks this quality is like a diagram;
it is not a picture. There must be relative
values, and the “witching glamour of the
past.” Give the old stories their appropriate
setting in time and place. Let the modern
story be the central figure against the universal
background of truth—a background
which will soften its sharper outlines, and
mellow its cruder tones. Preserve in the
classic the classical spirit, as well as the
classical form—that classical spirit which
kindles the fancy and stirs the imagination.
Let the hearers see their heroes through the
vista of vanishing years.</p>

<p>Technique is a necessary part of any artistic
production. Note how carefully the artist
selects his brushes and prepares his palette.
The story-teller should do no less. As the
brush of the artist must, to a certain extent,
influence the effect of his colors, so the voice
and manner of the story-teller must, to a certain
degree, affect the presentation of the
story. Even the manner of dress has its
influence. And so, with the example of the
artist before us, let us choose these minor
tools of our art with the single purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
their suitability. Let them be natural, simple,
harmonious. No judge of a picture thinks of
the canvas or the pigments. They are wholly
lost sight of. So will it be with the elements
of the story-teller’s equipment if they are
suitable; in other words, if they are in harmony
with her real purpose. But let us also
bear in mind the fact that a true artist can
do much with a poor brush, and the true
story-teller can achieve good results even
though the details of her equipment are not
at their best.</p>

<p>There must be variety in the story-pictures.
No one cares to look continually at the paintings
of even the greatest master, be he a
Michael Angelo, or a Velasquez. The water
colors of a Turner, or even the vagaries of a
Whistler afford needed change and variety—each
arousing our admiration, each presenting
its own phase of art. So we need not
always tell the stories of a Homer or a
Shakespeare. These may well be interspersed
with the tales of an Anderson, a Dickens, or
a Joel Chandler Harris.</p>

<p>There is an “indefinite something” about
art which raises it above the commonplace.
Perfection of craftsmanship does not produce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
this indescribable charm. It must emanate
from the personality of the worker.</p>

<p>Let us never confuse art with artificiality.
Art is nothing assumed; it is something felt.
Until we feel our story we can never tell it at
its best.</p>

<p>Not all are artists, few are great artists;
but you and I may do our best toward artistic
attainment, and comfort ourselves over
any lack of achievement by the reflection that
while only the favored few see the great masterpieces
of painting, the lives of the multitude
are made brighter and happier by the
work of the lesser artists, who, striving
against their limitations, have yet given to
the world their best.</p>

<h4>Why the Bear Sleeps All Winter<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h4>

<p>Once upon a time, little Brother Rabbit
lived, quite sober and industrious, in the
woods, and just close by lived a big, brown
Bear.</p>

<p>Now little Brother Rabbit never troubled
his neighbors in those days, nor meddled with
their housekeeping, nor played any tricks the
way he does now. In the fall, he gathered
his acorns, and his pignuts, and his rabbit
tobacco. On a frosty morning, he would set
out with Brother Fox for the farmer’s; and
while Brother Fox looked after the chicken
yards, little Brother Rabbit picked cabbage,
and pulled turnips, and gathered carrots and
parsnips for his cellar. When the winter
came, he never failed to share his store with
a wandering chipmunk.</p>

<p>Now, in those days, old Bear was not content
to do his own housekeeping, and doze
in the sun, and gather wild honey in the summer,
and fish through the ice in the winter.
He was full of mischief, and was always playing
tricks. Of all the beasts of the wood, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
one he loved best to trouble was sober little
Brother Rabbit.</p>

<p>Just as soon as Brother Rabbit moved to
a new tree stump, and filled his bins with
vegetables, and his pantry with salad, along
came old Bear and carried off all his stores.</p>

<p>Just as soon as Brother Rabbit filled his
house with dry, warm leaves for a bed, along
came old Bear, and tried to squeeze himself
into the bed, too, and of course he was too
big.</p>

<p>At last, Brother Rabbit could stand it no
longer, and he went to all the beasts in the
wood to ask their advice.</p>

<p>The first one he met was Brother Frog,
sitting on the edge of the pond, and sticking
his feet in the nice, cool mud.</p>

<p>“What shall I do, Brother Frog?” asked
Brother Rabbit; “Brother Bear will not
leave me alone.”</p>

<p>“Let us ask Brother Squirrel,” said
Brother Frog.</p>

<p>So the two went to Brother Squirrel, cracking
nuts in the hickory tree.</p>

<p>“What shall we do, Brother Squirrel?”
asked Brother Frog; “Brother Bear will not
leave Brother Rabbit alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>“Let us ask Brother Mole,” said Brother
Squirrel, dropping his nuts.</p>

<p>So the three went to where Brother Mole
was digging the cellar for a new house, and
they said:</p>

<p>“What shall we do, Brother Mole?
Brother Bear will not leave Brother Rabbit
alone.”</p>

<p>“Let us ask Brother Fox,” said Brother
Mole.</p>

<p>So Brother Mole, Brother Squirrel,
Brother Frog, and Brother Rabbit went to
where Brother Fox was combing his brush
behind a bush, and they said to him:</p>

<p>“What shall we do, Brother Fox? Brother
Bear will not leave Brother Rabbit alone.”</p>

<p>“Let us go to Brother Bear,” said
Brother Fox.</p>

<p>So they all went along with little Brother
Rabbit, and they hunted and hunted for old
Bear, but they could not find him anywhere.
They hunted and hunted some more, and at
last they peeped into a hollow tree. There
lay old Bear, fast asleep.</p>

<p>“Hush,” said Brother Fox.</p>

<p>Then he whispered to Brother Frog,
“Bring a little mud.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>And he whispered to Brother Squirrel,
“Bring some leaves.”</p>

<p>And he whispered to Brother Mole, “Bring
some dirt, little brother.”</p>

<p>And to Brother Rabbit he said, “Stand
ready to do what I tell you.”</p>

<p>So Brother Frog brought mud, Brother
Squirrel brought leaves, Brother Mole
brought dirt, and Brother Rabbit stood ready
to do what Brother Fox told him.</p>

<p>Then Brother Fox said to Brother Rabbit,
“Stop up the ends of Brother Bear’s log.”</p>

<p>So Brother Rabbit took the mud and the
leaves and the dirt, and he stopped up the
ends of the log. Then he hammered hard
with his two back feet, which are good for
hammering. And they all went home, for
they thought that old Bear would never,
never get out of the log.</p>

<p>Well, old Bear slept and slept, but after
a while he awoke, and he opened one eye.
He saw no sunshine, so he thought it was
still night, and he went to sleep again.</p>

<p>After another while, he awoke again, but
he heard the rain and sleet beating outside,
and it was very warm and dry inside.</p>

<p>“What a very long night,” said old Bear,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
and he curled up his paws, and he went to
sleep again.</p>

<p>This time, he just slept, and slept, until
it began to be very warm inside the log, and
he heard in his dreams the footsteps of birds
outside.</p>

<p>Then he awoke, and he stretched himself,
and he shook himself. He rubbed his eyes
with his paws, and he poked away the mud,
and the leaves, and the dirt, and he went
outside.</p>

<p>But was he not surprised?</p>

<p>It had been a frosty night when he had
gone to sleep, and now the woods were green.
Old Bear had slept all winter.</p>

<p>“That was a fine long sleep,” said old
Bear, as he set out for little Brother Rabbit’s
house to see if he had anything good for
breakfast; “and I shall go to sleep again,
next fall.”</p>

<p>So every summer, old Bear plays tricks
on little Brother Rabbit, but when fall comes,
he creeps away to a warm, dark place to sleep
until spring.</p>

<p>And so have his grandchildren, and his
great-grandchildren, and his great-great-grandchildren
ever since.</p>

<h4>The Little Boy Who Forgot to Wash His Hands<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></h4>

<p>Once upon a time, so very long ago that
of course there are no children like that now,
there was a little boy who almost <i>never</i>
washed his hands. He wrote with ink and
got ink on his fat little fore-finger; he made
pictures with his paints and daubed his
thumbs with red and yellow and blue color;
he made mud pies and splashed mud all over
his chubby palms and he never washed off
the ink or the paint or the mud.</p>

<p>And when anyone spoke of his dirty hands,
Bobby—that was the little boy’s name—would
say, “Oh, I forgot.” And then he
would keep right on forgetting all about nice
warm soap and soft dry towels, and pretty,
clean, pink hands.</p>

<p>One day, Bobby decided that he wanted
to play, very hard. The sun was up, there
was a soft, singing wind out in the garden,
and the whole world looked clean and happy.
So Bobby put on his cap, and because it is
always better to play with someone than to
play alone, Bobby called his big white pussy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
cat who often loved to chase up and down
the path that ran between the hedges.</p>

<p>“Come, pussy, pussy dear!” called Bobby,
“come and play with me.”</p>

<p>Then, because the white cat did not seem
to hear, Bobby stooped over and picked her
up in his arms. But the white cat wriggled
and scratched and spit at Bobby and jumped
out of his arms. She ran away from him and
hid beneath a chair.</p>

<p>“I wonder why she will not play with me,”
Bobby said as he went out into the garden.
There, on the door-step, stood Bobby’s white
dove with the pink, pink toes. Bobby loved
the white dove, who was very tame and often
flew to his shoulder, cooing gently in his ear.
He put his hand in his pocket and pulled out
a handful of grain which he scattered on the
door-step for the dove—pretty yellow grain
it was. But the white dove would not eat it,
and when Bobby called her, she flew away
from him, as far as the green gables at the
very top of the house.</p>

<p>“I wonder why she will not play with
me,” said Bobby, as he ran down the garden
path to the little round pond where his six
yellow gold fish lived. The six yellow gold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
fish were Bobby’s friends and they often
played with him as well as they knew how.
When he threw crumbs into the pond they
would come to the top with their little mouths
wide open, and would dart about in the shining
water as if they wanted Bobby to jump
in and swim about and enjoy the feast with
them.</p>

<p>But today, when Bobby gave them some
crumbs which he had in his pocket, they did
not come up to eat them. They stayed deep,
deep down in the pond.</p>

<p>“I wonder why—” Bobby began, and
then he happened to look down at the water.
The top of the pond was a shining mirror
and in it Bobby saw a picture of two little
black hands.</p>

<p>The crumbs that he had thrown to the six
yellow gold fish were black, too. The pretty
yellow grain that he gave the dove had been
black, and when he had lifted the white pussy
cat, his hands had left two big, black smudges
upon her beautiful white fur.</p>

<p>“Why, my hands are dirty,” exclaimed
Bobby.</p>

<p>You see, he had never really thought about
his hands before. So he went right into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
house to wash them and he never, <i>never</i>
forgot to wash them again.</p>

<h4>The Honest Woodman<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></h4>

<p>Once upon a time a poor woodman lived
with his family near a great forest. Every
week day he shouldered his ax very early
in the morning, and bidding his wife and children
good-by, went out to cut wood for his
master.</p>

<p>One day when he was chopping at the trunk
of a great tree growing near a stream, his
ax suddenly slipped out of his hands and
dropped with a splash into the water.</p>

<p>Oh, how troubled the poor man was! He
couldn’t earn a penny without an ax, and
he was too poor to buy one. He sat down
on the bank and wept as though his heart
would break.</p>

<p>“What is the trouble, my good man?”
asked a voice at his side. It was a fairy!
And such a jolly-looking fairy, too. He had
wings on his cap, and wings on his shoes,
and even on his staff!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>“I dropped my ax in the stream, and I
can’t chop wood any more, and my family
will starve,” sobbed the man.</p>

<p>Instantly Mercury, for that was the fairy’s
name, dived down into the water, and came
up, dripping wet, holding a beautiful golden
ax in his hand.</p>

<p>“Is this your ax?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, that is not mine.”</p>

<p>The good fairy dived into the stream again,
and this time brought up a silver ax.</p>

<p>“Is this yours?”</p>

<p>“No, that isn’t mine, either.” The poor
man needed an ax very much, but he would
not claim one that did not belong to him, of
course.</p>

<p>Once more Mercury plunged into the
water, but this time he came up with a common
ax in his hand.</p>

<p>“Is this your ax?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes! Oh, yes! that is mine!” cried the
man, joyfully. “Thank you so much for your
kindness. I am sorry you are so wet.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind that,” said Mercury. “It
is indeed a pleasure to meet such an honest
man. I will give you both the gold and the
silver axes as well as your own, and you can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
sell them for much gold, and you shall never
be poor again.” And he was gone before
the woodcutter had time to thank him.</p>

<p>The woodcutter went home a very happy
man, for now he would always have plenty
for his family. When his neighbors heard
about his good fortune, one of them who was
a lazy, good-for-nothing fellow decided to
try his luck in the same way. He went to
the stream, threw his ax in, and sitting down
on the bank, wept aloud as the honest woodman
had done.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mercury appeared to him.</p>

<p>“What is the trouble, my good man?” he
asked, as before.</p>

<p>“I dropped my ax in the river,” sobbed
the man.</p>

<p>Instantly the fairy dived into the water,
and in a moment came up with a golden ax
in his hand.</p>

<p>“Is this your ax?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Oh, yes! that is mine,” the dishonest
man cried, reaching out eagerly for
the beautiful golden tool.</p>

<p>But Mercury knew he was not speaking
the truth, and was very angry with him.
Instead of giving him the golden ax, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
dropped it into the stream and disappeared
without trying to find the man’s own ax. So,
instead of going home a rich man, as he had
expected, he went home poorer than he had
come.</p>

<h4>Tabby and the Mice<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></h4>

<p>Three little mice once lived in an old box.</p>

<p>“I am going to make a new house,” said
the largest mouse, whose name was Rus.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> am going to make a new house,” said
the next mouse, whose name was Fus.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> am going to make a new house,” said
the third mouse, who name was Mus.</p>

<p>“My house shall be made of hay,” said
Rus, who did not like to be cold.</p>

<p>“My house shall be made of paper,” said
Fus, who was fond of books.</p>

<p>“My house shall be made of bricks,” said
Mus, who was as wise as he could be.</p>

<p>So the three little mice made their homes.</p>

<p>One day Tabby Cat came along. She saw
the three houses that the little mice had made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>She was a very polite old cat, so she
knocked at the door of the first house.</p>

<p>“Come, Mr. Rus; please let me in!” said
she.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Rus; “you can’t come in.”</p>

<p>Tabby was a wise old cat. She put her
soft paw into the hay and caught poor Rus.</p>

<p>Then she went to the next house. “Come,
Mr. Fus; let me in,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” said Fus, “you can’t come in.”</p>

<p>But Tabby knew better than that. She
put her paw through the paper door and
caught poor Fus. Then she went to the next
house.</p>

<p>“Come, Mr. Mus; let me in!” said she.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” said Mus; “when I am
ready.”</p>

<p>So Tabby sat down to wait. She laughed
when she thought what a nice supper Mus
would make.</p>

<p>When she had waited a long time, she
grew tired.</p>

<p>“Are you ready now, Mr. Mus?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said Mus.</p>

<p>By and by Tabby knocked loudly on the
door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>“I am coming in now, Mr. Mus,” said she.</p>

<p>“Very well; come in if you like,” said
Mus; but he did not open the door.</p>

<p>So Tabby tried and tried to open the door.</p>

<p>Then she tried to push down the house.
Then she tried to make Mus come out. At
last she told Mus just what she thought of
him.</p>

<p>This did not trouble Mus at all. He had
curled himself up in a snug corner of his
house and was fast asleep.</p>

<h4>The Gold Bugs<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></h4>

<p>Once upon a time there were two green and
glittering gold bugs, and one said to the
other:</p>

<p>“The day is warm and sunny; let us go
out and play.”</p>

<p>“We will,” said the second gold bug, and
they decided to play at dancing.</p>

<p>So the two green, glittering gold bugs went
down to a brook near by, and there, shining
and floating above the water, they saw two
glorious dragon flies, one green, and one blue.</p>

<p>“We will dance with these dragon flies,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
said one gold bug. “I choose the blue one.”</p>

<p>“You cannot have her,” said the other
gold bug, “I choose her.”</p>

<p>“I will dance with the blue dragon fly,”
said the second gold bug.</p>

<p>So they quarreled until two other gold bugs
came along, and asked the dragon flies to
dance with them, so that was an end of the
matter.</p>

<p>The two green and glittering gold bugs
then said they would play at something else.</p>

<p>“We will play hide and seek,” said the
first gold bug.</p>

<p>“No, we will play tag,” said the second
gold bug.</p>

<p>“I will play nothing but hide and seek,”
said the first gold bug.</p>

<p>“And I will play nothing but tag,” said
the second gold bug.</p>

<p>“I am going to hide,” said the first gold
bug; so he went away and hid himself beneath
a clover leaf, but, ah, there was no
one to blind, and then go and look for him.</p>

<p>“I will run,” said the second gold bug;
so he ran, but, ah, there was no one to catch
him. It was not fun to play that way, and
there was an end of the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>The two green and glittering gold bugs
then said they would play at something else,
so they went to a tall bell flower to swing.</p>

<p>“I will sit inside, and you shall rock me,”
said the first gold bug.</p>

<p>“No, I will sit inside first, and you shall
rock me,” said the second gold bug.</p>

<p>So they quarreled as to which should swing
first, and in their quarreling they tore a
petal of the beautiful bell flower, so they
could not swing at all, and there was an end
of the matter.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, what is the meaning of this?”
asked an old gold bug who came crawling
along just then. “Why do you two green
and glittering young things quarrel this
bright morning?”</p>

<p>“We cannot play, and we are very unhappy,
grandfather,” said the two gold bugs.
“We do not both wish to play at the same
games.”</p>

<p>“Silly, silly,” said the old gold bug, and
as he crawled away, he turned his head about,
and he said, “Take turns, take turns. Turn
about is fair play.”</p>

<p>Now it had never occurred to the two green
and glittering gold bugs that to take turns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
is the best way to play, and they decided to
try.</p>

<p>They went back to the brook, and there
were the two beautiful dragon flies, again
floating over the water. So the first gold bug
danced with the green dragon fly, and the
second gold bug danced with the blue dragon
fly; and then they changed about until they
could dance no longer.</p>

<p>After that they played tag, and the first
gold bug chased the second gold bug until
they were tired. Then the first gold bug hid
himself, and the second gold bug tried to
find him, which was very good fun indeed.</p>

<p>And last of all they found another bell
flower, and they rocked each other all the
afternoon, until it was time to go home.</p>

<p>So they had a very good day after all, did
those green and glittering gold bugs, for they
had learned that to take turns is the best
way to play.</p>

<h4>The History of Tip-Top<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></h4>

<p>Under the window of a certain pretty cottage
there grew a great old apple tree, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
in the spring had thousands and thousands
of lovely pink blossoms on it, and in the
autumn had many bright red apples.</p>

<p>The nursery of this cottage was a little
bower of a room, and here five little children
used to come to be dressed and have their
hair brushed and curled every morning.</p>

<p>Now it used to happen, every morning, that
the five little heads would be peeping out of
the window, together, into the flowery boughs
of the apple tree; and the reason was this.
A pair of robins had built a very pretty,
smooth-lined nest directly under the window.
The robins, at first, had been rather shy of
this inspection; but, as they got better acquainted,
they seemed to think no more of
the little curly heads in the window than of
the pink blossoms about them, or the daisies
and buttercups at the foot of the tree.</p>

<p>When the little nest was finished, it was
so neat, and workmanlike, that the children
all exulted over it, and called it “our nest,”
and the two robins they called “our birds.”
But wonderful was the joy when the little
eyes, opening one morning, saw in the nest
a beautiful pale-green egg; and the joy grew
from day to day, for every day there came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
another egg, and so on till there were five
little eggs.</p>

<p>After that the mother bird began to sit on
the eggs, and then it seemed a very long
time for the children to wait. But one morning,
when they pushed their five curly heads
out of the window, the patient little bird was
gone and there seemed to be nothing left in
the little nest but a bunch of something
hairy.</p>

<p>“O, mamma, do come here!” they cried,
“the bird has gone and left her nest!” But
at that five little red mouths opened wide,
and then they saw that the hairy bunch of
stuff was five little birds.</p>

<p>“They are dreadful looking things,” said
one of the children; “I didn’t know that
little birds began by looking so bad.”</p>

<p>But after this it was great fun to watch
the parent birds feed this nestful of little red
mouths, until it became a nestful of little, fat,
speckled robins.</p>

<p>Then, as there were five children, and five
robins, they each chose one bird for his own,
and they named them Brown-Eyes, Tip-Top,
Singer, Toddy, and Speckle.</p>

<p>Time went on, and as Brown-Eyes, Tip-Top,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
Singer, Toddy, and Speckle grew bigger,
they began to make a very crowded nestful
of birds.</p>

<p>Now the children had been taught a little
verse which said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Birds in their little nests agree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And ’tis a shameful sight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When children of one family</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Fall out, and chide, and fight;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and they thought anything really written and
printed must be true; therefore they were
very much astonished to see, from day to
day, that <i>their</i> little birds in their nest did
<i>not</i> agree.</p>

<p>Tip-Top was the biggest and strongest
bird, and he was always shuffling and crowding
the others, and clamoring for the most
food. Speckle was a bird of spirit, and he
used to peck at Tip-Top, while Brown-Eyes
was a meek, tender little fellow. As for
Toddy and Singer, they turned out to be sister
birds, and showed quite a feminine talent
for chattering.</p>

<p>“I say,” said Tip-Top one day, “this old
nest is a dull, crowded hole, and it’s quite
time some of us were out of it.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy,” said Mother Robin, “we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
shall teach you to fly as soon as your wings
are strong enough.”</p>

<p>“Humbug!” cried Tip-Top, balancing
with his short little tail on the edge of the
nest. “Look at those swallows, skimming
and diving through the blue air! That’s the
way I want to do.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy,” said his mother, “do go
into the nest and be a good little bird, and
then you will be happy.”</p>

<p>“I’m too big for the nest,” said Tip-Top,
“and I want to see the world. It’s full of
beautiful things, I know. Now there’s the
most lovely creature with bright eyes, that
comes under the tree every day, and wants
me to come down in the grass and play with
her.”</p>

<p>“My son, my son, beware!” said the
frightened mother; “that seemingly lovely
creature is our dreadful enemy, the cat—a
horrid monster, with teeth and claws.”</p>

<p>At this all the little birds shuddered and
cuddled deeper into the nest—all but Tip-Top,
who <i>didn’t believe it</i>.</p>

<p>So the next morning, after the father and
mother were gone, Tip-Top got on the edge
of the nest again, and looked over and saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
lovely Miss Pussy washing her face among
the daisies under the tree, and her hair was
smooth and white as the daisies, and her eyes
were yellow and beautiful to behold, and she
looked up to the tree bewitchingly and said,
“Little birds, little birds, come down.
Pussy wants to play with you.”</p>

<p>“Only look at her!” said Tip-Top; “her
eyes are like gold.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t look,” said Singer and Speckle.
“She will bewitch you and then eat you up;
mother said so.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see her try to eat me up,”
said Tip-Top, again balancing his short tail
over the edge of the nest. “Her paws are
as white as velvet, and so soft! I don’t
believe she has any claws.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go, brother, don’t!” screamed both
sisters.</p>

<p>A moment after, a dreadful scream was
heard from the nursery window. “O,
mamma, mamma, do come here! Tip-Top’s
fallen out of the nest, and the cat has got
him!”</p>

<p>Poor, foolish Tip-Top!</p>

<p>But in another moment the children were
in the yard, and Jamie plunged under a bush<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
and caught the cat, with luckless Tip-Top in
her mouth.</p>

<p>Tip-Top was not dead, but some of his
pretty feathers were gone, and one of his
wings was broken.</p>

<p>“Oh, what <i>shall</i> we do for him!” cried
the children. “Poor Tip-Top!”</p>

<p>“We will put him back into the nest, children,”
said mamma. “His mother will know
best what to do for him.”</p>

<p>So a ladder was brought, and papa climbed
up and put poor Tip-Top safely into the nest.
The cat had shaken all the nonsense well out
of him, and he was a dreadfully humbled
young robin.</p>

<p>And when the time came for all the other
little birds to learn to fly, poor Tip-Top was
still confined to the nest with his broken wing.</p>

<h4>The Good King<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></h4>

<p>Once upon a time there was a King in
Spain who had only one leg. He was a Good
King, and he had a big Animal Farm where
he kept all the animals who had lost one or
more of their legs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>In another part of Spain there was a Little
Half Chick with only one eye, one wing, and
one leg. The other chickens with two eyes
and two legs gobbled up the corn so fast that
Little Half Chick was nearly starved.</p>

<p>One day a Donkey told Little Half Chick
about the Good King and his Animal Farm.
Little Half Chick at once started hoppity-hop
for Mother Hen and said:</p>

<p>“Mother Hen, I am going to Madrid to see
the Good King.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Mother Hen, “good
luck to you.”</p>

<p>So Little Half Chick started off, hoppity-hop,
hoppity-hop, along the road to Madrid
to see the Good King.</p>

<p>Soon she met a Two-legged Cat going along
hippity-hip, hippity-hip, on her leg and
crutch. The Cat said:</p>

<p>“Hello, Little Half Chick, where are you
going so fast?”</p>

<p>Little Half Chick said, “I am going to
Madrid to see the Good King.”</p>

<p>“May I go too?” said the Two-legged Cat.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Little Half Chick, “fall in
behind.”</p>

<p>So the Cat fell in behind. Hoppity-hop,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
hoppity-hop, went Little Half Chick. Hippity-hip,
hippity-hip, went the Two-legged
Cat.</p>

<p>Soon they met a Three-legged Dog going
along humpity-hump, humpity-hump. The
Dog said:</p>

<p>“Hello, Little Half Chick, where are you
going so fast?”</p>

<p>Little Half Chick said, “I am going to
Madrid to see the Good King.”</p>

<p>“May I go too?” said the Three-legged
Dog.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Little Half Chick, “fall in
behind.”</p>

<p>So the Dog fell in behind. Hoppity-hop,
hoppity-hop, went Little Half Chick. Hippity-hip,
hippity-hip, went the Two-legged
Cat.</p>

<p>Humpity-hump, humpity-hump, went the
Three-legged Dog.</p>

<p>Soon they met a One-legged Crow going
along jumpity-jump, jumpity-jump. The
Crow said:</p>

<p>“Hello, Little Half Chick, where are you
going so fast?”</p>

<p>Little Half Chick said, “I am going to
Madrid to see the Good King.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>“May I go too?” said the One-legged
Crow.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Little Half Chick, “fall in
behind.”</p>

<p>So the Crow fell in behind. Hoppity-hop,
hoppity-hop, went Little Half Chick. Hippity-hip,
hippity-hip, went the Two-legged
Cat. Humpity-hump, humpity-hump, went
the Three-legged Dog. Jumpity-jump, jumpity-jump,
went the One-legged Crow.</p>

<p>Soon they met a Snake with no legs at all.
He had caught his tail in his teeth, and was
rolling along, loopity-loop, loopity-loop. The
Snake said:</p>

<p>“Hello, Little Half Chick, where are you
going so fast?”</p>

<p>“I am going to Madrid to see the Good
King,” said Little Half Chick.</p>

<p>“May I go too?” said the Snake.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Little Half Chick, “fall in
behind.”</p>

<p>So the Snake fell in behind. Hoppity-hop,
hoppity-hop, went Little Half Chick. Hippity-hip,
hippity-hip, went the Two-legged
Cat. Humpity-hump, humpity-hump, went
the Three-legged Dog. Jumpity-jump, jumpity-jump,
went the One-legged Crow. Loopity-loop,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
loopity-loop, went the Snake with no
legs at all.</p>

<p>Soon they came to Madrid and saw the
Good King. With the King was his little
daughter Margaret. They both laughed as
all these funny animals came up. The King
said to Little Margaret:</p>

<p>“Do you want to see us all go out to the
Animal Farm?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Little Margaret, “I will lead
the way.”</p>

<p>So she led the way along the street to the
Animal Farm. Behind Margaret came the
One-legged King. Next came Little Half
Chick, next the Two-legged Cat, next the
Three-legged Dog, next the One-legged Crow,
and last of all the Snake with no legs at all.
So they all went out to the Animal Farm.
And there they lived happily ever after.</p>

<h4>The Plowman Who Found Content<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></h4>

<p>A plowman paused in his work one day to
rest. As he sat on the handle of his plow
he fell a-thinking. The world had not been
going well with him of late, and he could
not help feeling downhearted. Just then he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
saw an old woman looking at him over the
hedge.</p>

<p>“Good-morning!” she said. “If you are
wise you will take my advice.”</p>

<p>“And what is your advice?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Leave your plow, and walk straight on
for two days. At the end of that time you
will find yourself in the middle of a forest,
and in front of you there will be a tree towering
high above the others. Cut it down, and
your fortune will be made.”</p>

<p>With these words the old woman hobbled
down the road, leaving the plowman wondering.
He unharnessed his horses, drove them
home, and said good-by to his wife; and then
taking his ax, started out.</p>

<p>At the end of two days he came to the tree,
and set to work to cut it down. As it crashed
to the ground a nest containing two eggs fell
from its topmost branches. The shells of the
eggs were smashed, and out of one came a
young eagle, while from the other rolled a
small gold ring.</p>

<p>The eagle rapidly became larger and larger,
till it was of full size; then, flapping its wings,
it flew up.</p>

<p>“I thank you, honest man, for giving me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
my freedom,” it called out. “In token of
my gratitude take the ring—it is a wishing
ring. If you wish anything as you turn it
round on your finger, your wish will be fulfilled.
But remember this—the ring contains
but one wish, so think well before you
use it.”</p>

<p>The man put the ring on his finger, and
set off on his homeward journey. Night was
coming on when he entered a town. Almost
the first person he saw was a goldsmith
standing at the door of his shop. So he went
up to him, and asked him what the ring was
worth.</p>

<p>The goldsmith looked at it carefully, and
handed it back to the man with a smile.</p>

<p>“It is of very little value,” he said.</p>

<p>The plowman laughed.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Goldsmith,” he cried, “you have
made a mistake this time. My ring is worth
more than all you have in your shop; it’s a
wishing-ring, and will give me anything I
care to wish for.”</p>

<p>The goldsmith felt annoyed and asked to
see it again.</p>

<p>“Well, my good man,” he said, “never
mind about the ring. I dare say you are far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
from home, and are in want of some supper
and a bed for the night. Come in and spend
the night in my house.”</p>

<p>The man gladly accepted the offer, and was
soon sound asleep. In the middle of the night
the goldsmith took the ring from his finger,
and put another just like it in its place without
disturbing him in the least.</p>

<p>Next morning the countryman went on his
way, all unconscious of the trick that had
been played on him. When he had gone the
goldsmith closed the shutters of his shop,
and bolted the door; then turning the ring
on his finger he said, “I wish for a hundred
thousand sovereigns!”</p>

<p>Scarcely had the sound of his voice died
away than there fell about him a shower of
hard, bright, golden sovereigns. They struck
him on the head, on the shoulders, on the
hands. They covered the floor. Presently
the floor gave way beneath the weight, and
the goldsmith and his gold fell into the cellar
beneath.</p>

<p>Next morning, when the goldsmith did not
open the shop as usual, the neighbors forced
open the door, and found him buried beneath
the pile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the countryman reached his
home, and told his wife of the ring.</p>

<p>“Now, good wife,” said he, “here is the
ring; our fortune is made. Of course we
must consider the matter well; then, when
we have made up our minds as to what is
best, we can express some very big wish as I
turn the ring on my finger.”</p>

<p>“Suppose,” said the woman, “we were to
wish for a nice farm; the land we have now
is so small as to be almost useless.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the husband; “but, on the
other hand, if we work hard and spend little
for a year or two we might be able to buy
as much as we want. Then we could get
something else with the wishing-ring.”</p>

<p>So it was agreed. For a year the man and
his wife worked hard. Harvest came, and
the crops were splendid. At the end of the
year they were able to buy a nice farm, and
still had some money left.</p>

<p>“There,” said the man, “we have the
land, and we still have our wish.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said his wife, “we could do very
well with a horse and a cow.”</p>

<p>“They are not worth wishing for,” said
he; “we can get them as we got the land.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>So they went on working steadily and
spending wisely for another year. At the end
of that time they bought both a horse and a
cow. Husband and wife were greatly pleased
with their good fortune, for, said they, “We
have got the things we wanted and we have
still our wish.”</p>

<p>As time went on everything prospered with
the worthy couple. They worked hard, and
were happy. Indeed, the husband would
probably have forgotten all about the ring
had not his wife constantly asked him to wish
for something.</p>

<p>“Let us work while we are young,” her
husband would answer. “Life is still before
us, and who can say how badly we may need
our wish some day.”</p>

<p>So the years passed away. Every season
saw the bounds of the farm increase and the
granaries grow fuller. All day long the
farmer was about in the fields, while his wife
looked after the house and the dairy. Sometimes,
as they sat alone of an evening, she
would remind him of the unused wishing-ring,
and would talk of things she would like to
have for the house. But he always replied
that there was still plenty of time for that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>The man and his wife grew old and gray.
Then came a day when they both died—and
the wishing-ring had not been used. It was
still on his finger as he had worn it for forty
years. One of his sons was going to take it
off, but the oldest said:</p>

<p>“Do not disturb it; there has been some
secret in connection with it. Perhaps our
mother gave it to him, for I have often seen
her look longingly at it.”</p>

<p>Thus the old man was buried with the ring,
which was supposed to be a wishing-ring, but
which, as we know, was not, though it brought
the old couple more good fortune and happiness
than all the wishing in the world could
ever have given them.</p>

<h4>King of the Frogs<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></h4>

<p>Once upon a time—so long ago that the
oldest frog now living does not remember it—all
the frogs of a far-away country came
together in solemn council.</p>

<p>“I propose,” said a big green fellow with
a very deep voice, “that we ask to have a
king appointed to rule over us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>“What do we want of a king?” asked a
small and inquisitive frog.</p>

<p>But his voice was hardly heard, for all the
other frogs shouted together, “Yes, let us
have a king. Let us have a king.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t we all we need, now, to make us
happy?” asked the little, inquisitive frog
again. But nobody paid the slightest attention
to him.</p>

<p>So the other frogs sent a request to the
Great Ruler of the land, asking that he
appoint a king to rule over them.</p>

<p>“A king of the frogs!” said the Great
Ruler, when he heard their request. And
then he knit his brows and thought for a very
long time.</p>

<p>But nobody knew that his thoughts were
the same as those of the little, inquisitive
frog to whom nobody had paid any attention.</p>

<p>At last the Great Ruler spoke.</p>

<p>“Why do you want a king?” he asked.
“Have you not, now, everything you need
to make you happy?”</p>

<p>But all the frogs shouted in chorus, “Give
us a king. Give us a king.”</p>

<p>So the Great Ruler knit his brows and
thought again for a very long time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>At length he spoke. “I will give you a
great log for a king. It will bear you upon
the water and the sun will shine upon you
as you rest on its broad surface.”</p>

<p>But the frogs were angry at this. “The
idea!” they shouted. “We want a living
king; we want no dead log for a king.”</p>

<p>So the Great Ruler knit his brows and
thought again for a very long time.</p>

<p>At length he spoke. “Since you insist
upon it, I will give you the stork for your
king.”</p>

<p>Then all the frogs sang joyfully, “Yes, we
will have the stork for our king. The stork
is our king! The stork is our king!”</p>

<p>So the stork was sent to rule over them,
and as soon as he came among them he began
to eat. And he ate and ate—till he had
swallowed <i>every frog in the land</i>.</p>

<h4>The Adder That Did Not Hear<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></h4>

<p>Away in the midst of the forest, there lived
a tiny adder. He was so very little that the
great beasts never thought of talking to him.
But the spiders and the wasps and the frogs
often stopped to visit at his doorway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>One morning, as a frog hopped down the
path, he stopped and called “Good morning.
I’ve a bit of news for you.”</p>

<p>“Good morning,” replied the adder. “I
hope it is good news, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“What’s good news to one person may
be bad news to another,” croaked the frog.
“But listen! As I came along through the
forest I heard a great chattering among the
monkeys, and I stopped to hear what it was
all about.</p>

<p>“One little monkey sat crying in the midst
of them, and the others were all saying,
‘You know you tried to steal—’”</p>

<p>But the adder had rolled over so that one
ear lay close to the ground, and he had stuck
the end of his tail in the other ear. Of course
he couldn’t hear another word of what the
frog was saying.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said the frog, looking very
much offended. “That is a great way to
treat a friend, I am sure.” And he hopped
off into the rushes.</p>

<p>Presently a wasp flew down by the adder’s
home and settled upon a leaf near by.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said the adder politely.
“What a beautiful day this is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” buzzed the wasp, “it’s nice today,
but there’s sure to be a storm—”</p>

<p>But the adder had rolled over so that one
ear lay close to the ground, and he had stuck
the end of his tail into the other ear.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare,” buzzed the wasp
angrily. “What an impertinent fellow.”
And she flew away as fast as ever she could.</p>

<p>The adder straightened himself out and
went about his work once more, thinking as
he did so how bright the sunlight was, and
how soft and warm the air felt, and how beautifully
the birds were singing.</p>

<p>Presently a little brown spider dropped a
thread from her web and ran down to the
adder’s doorway.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” she said. “I have come
to invite you to a forest revel. Why are you
always so quiet? You should come with us
and not mind what the sober workers tell
you. We will have music and dancing and
wine and song—”</p>

<p>But the adder had rolled over so that one
ear lay close to the ground and he had stuck
the end of his tail into the other ear.</p>

<p>“Such manners!” exclaimed the spider,
and she climbed the thread back to her web.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>And so it came about that the small people
of the forest began to have this saying
amongst them, “He’s as deaf as an adder.”</p>

<h4>The North Star<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></h4>

<p>Three Ojibway hunters had been out hunting
for meat many days; it was in a new
place. The woods were very thick, but there
were no deer in them. The hunters had nothing
to eat; they had no water, for there was
none; they were lost in the thick forest.</p>

<p>The hunters sat down and smoked the pipe
of peace. They offered the smoke to the Manitous
who might live in the woods. They
asked the Manitous to help them. The day
sun was gone and there was no night sun.</p>

<p>The chief covered his head with his blanket
and chanted: “Our wigwams will see us
no more. We will stay here forever. We can
go no further.”</p>

<p>A little Pukwudjinnie came out of a hollow
tree when the chief had chanted his story.
The Little One was like a little papoose, but
he was very old and knew very much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>He said: “I will help the hunters. I will
show you the trail.”</p>

<p>He pulled the thick bushes apart, and the
hunters followed. He found the trail and
soon came upon a herd of deer feeding in the
bush. The hunters shot two deer and ate
much meat; they were stronger after they
had eaten the meat. The Little One did not
eat; he was not hungry.</p>

<p>There was no rain, and the hunters had
no water; they lost their strength and could
not walk on the trail. The Pukwudjinnie
left them; then the hunters put their blankets
over their heads and sat down. They
said no words. They could not smoke the
pipe of peace, for their strength was all gone.</p>

<p>The Little One came back with a deer-skin
full of drink for them; he poured it
into their mouths; it was not water; it was
like no drink they ever had before. They
became very strong and wanted nothing more
to eat or drink for more than one moon.</p>

<p>He led them on a long trail, to the land of
his Little People; he took them to his own
chief. The chief was like a little papoose, but
he knew all the trails in the forest. He knew
all the trails in the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>The little chief showed the Ojibway chief
the star in the north, the star that never
moves. The little chief showed them how to
watch this star and not lose their trail. He
found their lost trail for them and sent them
home.</p>

<p>The three hunters came back to their own
wigwams. They talked in the council and
showed their people the star that never
moves.</p>

<p>Other nations and tribes know this star
now, but the Ojibways believe that their people
were the first to know where to find it
in the Great Blue Wigwam.</p>

<h4>The Cobbler<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></h4>

<p>Once upon a time there lived a cobbler who
sat day after day in his shop, working away
at his cobbler’s last—just making shoes.</p>

<p>After a time he came to think that because
he had made so very many pairs of shoes, he
knew more about them than anybody else in
the world.</p>

<p>He grew quite puffed up with pride, and
was always looking for some way of showing
his knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>One day as he was walking in the public
square of the town, he saw a statue which
had been made by a great artist. And he
discovered—ha-ha-ha—he discovered that
the shoe-latchet of the statue was not made
just right.</p>

<p>“Aha, aha!” he said, and his chest swelled
with pride and delight. “Here is a statue
made by a great artist—but he does not
know how a shoe-latchet is made. Surely, I
am greater than he!”</p>

<p>Then he began to look the statue over
to see what other mistakes he might find.
And after a while it seemed to him that the
legs of the statue were not shaped just
right, either.</p>

<p>“I will go to the Lord Mayor of the town,”
he said to himself, “and order the statue
removed from our public square.”</p>

<p>So he went to the Lord Mayor’s palace,
and when he came into the Lord Mayor’s
presence, he said, “May it please your
Honor, I have discovered great errors in
the statue which is in our public square, and
I have come to petition your Honor to have
it removed.”</p>

<p>Then the Lord Mayor looked the cobbler<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
over gravely, and asked, “Can you make a
better statue to put in its place?”</p>

<p>At that the cobbler turned quite red and
stammered, “Oh, no, your Honor; but I can
make a better shoe-latchet.”</p>

<p>“Then, Sir Cobbler,” replied the Lord
Mayor, “I would advise you to stick to
your last.”</p>

<h4>Opechee the Robin Redbreast<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></h4>

<p>A great hunter among the Chippewas, or
Ojibways, wanted his son to secure a powerful
spirit to protect him in war and all
danger. To gain the help of the strong Manitou
the boy must fast twelve days.</p>

<p>Many Indian boys can do this, but not all.
Many try and fail.</p>

<p>The boy did as his father commanded, for
when the time came he went into the secret
lodge in the deep forest and laid himself
down alone on the mat his mother had woven
for him. He did not fear, but his strength
was weak. All night he lay there alone.</p>

<p>In the morning his father came and asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
him if the strong spirit had come to him in
his dreams. The boy shook his head. No
dreams had come to him.</p>

<p>Each day for ten days the father came to
the little lodge in the wilderness and asked
his son if the strong Manitou had come to
him.</p>

<p>“It is not for me to have such dreams,
my father, I am not brave. The strong Manitou
will not come to me. Let me give up
my fast.”</p>

<p>“If you give up now, the Manitou will
never come. Hunger makes my son weak,
but his heart is strong. It is only a short
time more to wait. Then my son shall be
the strongest of all.”</p>

<p>The Indian boy covered his face and lay
still upon the mat. He would obey his
father.</p>

<p>On the morning of the eleventh day
the boy saw his father enter the wigwam.
He slowly turned his face toward him and
whispered: “Let me break my fast; I have
no dreams.”</p>

<p>“Tomorrow I will bring you food. Tomorrow
you shall come to the lodge of your
father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>The boy closed his eyes and said no more.
He was very weak and faint.</p>

<p>The next morning the father went with the
earliest morning light to the little lodge in
the forest. Peeping through the door he saw
his son sitting up. Beside his mat were
brushes and paint. He was painting himself
red and brown.</p>

<p>“The Manitou will free me, but it is not
the spirit my father wanted,” he heard the
boy say.</p>

<p>The father rushed into the lodge, but as
he touched his boy the lad changed into a
bird and flew out of the open doorway. Sitting
on the top of the lodge he sang these
words:</p>

<p>“Do not mourn for me, my father, for I
am happy. I did not want to be a warrior.
I wanted only to be free. I shall find food
upon the fields and the hills. I will comfort
you.” Then he flew away.</p>

<p>Opechee lives near the homes of men. He
loves to comfort them when they are sad.
He is happy when they are happy.</p>

<p>His songs are for the little children and
for the fathers and mothers who want their
little ones to be brave. Opechee is not afraid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
in the storm, and many have heard him singing
just after the great thunder-birds had
called to each other and the water was coming
fast from the sky to find a place to hide in
the ground. Opechee is brave, but not
strong.</p>

<h4>The Country Cat<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></h4>

<p>The big white cat trotting across the lawn
with a rat in his mouth started Meriky on
a story this afternoon.</p>

<p>“Huh!” exclaimed Meriky, “cats and
mouses didn’t used to be sich bad friends

<p>“Once upon a time dey visited back an’

<h4>Legend of the Arbutus<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></h4>

<p>An old tepee stood by a frozen river in
the forest where there are many pine trees.
The tops of the trees were white with snow.
The tepee was almost covered with the snow.
An old chief sat in this tepee; his hair was
like the icicles that hang from dead pine-tree
branches; he was very old.</p>

<p>He was covered with furs. The floor of his
tepee was covered with the skins of the bear
and the elk. He had been a great hunter.
His name was Peboan. Peboan was faint
with hunger, and he was cold. He had been
hunting for three days. He had killed nothing.
All the moose, deer, and bear had gone.
They had left no trail. Wabasso, the rabbit,
had hidden in the bushes. There was no
food, no meat, for Peboan.</p>

<p>He called upon the great Menabozho for
help.</p>

<p>“Come, Menabozho, come help Peboan, the
chief of the winter Manitous. Come, for
Mukwa, the bear, has gone from me. Come,
or Peboan must go to the far north to find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
Mahto, the white bear. Peboan is old, and
his feet are weary.”</p>

<p>Peboan crawled on his knees over the furs
to the little fire in the middle of the tepee.
He blew on the coals with his faint breath,
and the coals grew very red. His breath
was like a wind; the coals made the wind
warm like a south wind. The deerskins that
covered the tepee trembled like leaves, for
the warm wind blew them.</p>

<p>Peboan sat on the furs on the floor of his
tepee and waited. He knew Menabozho
would hear him.</p>

<p>Peboan heard no sound, but he looked
toward the door of his tepee. It was lifted
back, and he saw a beautiful Indian maiden.</p>

<p>She carried a great bundle of willow buds
in her arms. Her dress was of sweet grass
and early maple leaves. Her eyes were like
a young deer. Her hair was like the blackest
feathers of a crow, and it was so long that
it was like a blanket over her shoulders. She
was small; her feet were hidden in two moccasin
flowers.</p>

<p>“Menabozho heard Peboan, the winter
Manitou. He has sent me. I am Segun.”</p>

<p>“You are welcome, Segun. Sit by my fire;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
it is warm. I have no meat. Sit down and
tell me what you can do.”</p>

<p>“Peboan may tell first,” said Segun.</p>

<p>Peboan said: “I am a winter Manitou;
I blow my breath, and the flowers die. The
waters stand still; the leaves fall and die.”</p>

<p>Segun said: “I am a summer Manitou;
I blow my breath, and the flowers open their
eyes. The waters follow me on my trail.”</p>

<p>Peboan said: “I shake my hair, and the
snow falls on the mountains, like the feathers
of Waubese, the great white swan.”</p>

<p>Segun said: “I shake my hair, and warm
rain falls from the clouds. I call, and the
birds answer me. The trees put on their
leaves, and the grass grows thick like the
fur of the bear. The summer sky is my tepee.
Menabozho has said that the time has come
for you to go.”</p>

<p>Peboan’s head bent over on his shoulder.
The sun melted the snow on the pine trees;
it melted the snow on the tepee. Segun
waved her hands over Peboan, and a strange
thing happened.</p>

<p>Peboan grew smaller and smaller. His
deer-skin clothes turned to leaves and covered
Peboan on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>Segun looked, but Peboan was gone. She
took some flowers from her hair and hid them
under the leaves on the ground. There was
ice on the leaves, but it did not hurt the pink
flowers. Segun breathed on the flowers, and
they became sweet.</p>

<p>She said: “I go, but the flowers shall
stay to tell of Segun’s visit to Peboan. The
children shall find them and know that Segun
has sent Peboan away. It shall be so each
time the snows melt and the rivers begin
to run. This flower shall tell that spring has
come.”</p>

<p>Peboan’s tepee was sweet with the breath
of the flowers, but Segun was gone.</p>

<h4>Why the Dog Cannot Endure the Cat, Nor the Cat the Mouse<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></h4>

<p>Long years ago it was the custom to give
the dog all the meat that fell from the master’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
table. But one day when all the dogs
met in council, one of them said, “It might
be a wise plan to have an agreement drawn
up for the dogs and their masters to sign.</p>

<p>“Some time,” said he, “one of our masters
might drink too much wine, or get into
a rage, and forbid us to have the meat. And
then what could we do? It is best to be on
the safe side,” and he shook his head sagely.</p>

<p>“That is a very good plan,” agreed the
other dogs. “Let us carry it out at once.”</p>

<p>So the secretary of the dogs’ council drew
up a document and wrote it upon parchment.
It stated that all the dogs of every country
were entitled to the meat that fell from their
masters’ tables. It was a very carefully
worded document, and it was written out in
the most learned form by the lawyer of the
council.</p>

<p>Then the secretary took the parchment,
rolled it up and went about the whole land
until it had been signed by all the masters of
dogs.</p>

<p>The parchment was then given to the King
of the Dogs, to be carefully kept.</p>

<p>The King of the Dogs gave the parchment
to his private secretary, the Tomcat, telling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
him that it was a very important document,
and must be put away with the greatest care.</p>

<p>Tomcat took the parchment and went
softly away to the garret, where he hid the
precious document behind a beam.</p>

<p>For a long time there was no need of
bringing out the parchment, for all the masters
did as they had agreed, and the dogs
fared well.</p>

<p>But one day it happened that Master Miller
had a new cook who was very careless, and
when this cook brought in a prime roast of
beef, he let it slip from the platter to the
floor.</p>

<p>Instantly it was seized upon by Dog Trophy,
who started off with it.</p>

<p>But Master Miller was in no mood to lose
his dinner, and he snatched the roast from
Dog Trophy, telling him that he was a thief.
Then he rubbed Dog Trophy’s paw with hot
ashes to teach him not to steal.</p>

<p>Dog Trophy’s heart burned with indignation,
and his paw burned with the hot ashes,
and he went away on three legs as fast as
ever he could to the King of the Dogs.</p>

<p>When he reached the King’s house, he set
forth his case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>“Bring out the official parchment,” called
the King, when Dog Trophy had told his
story.</p>

<p>Tomcat ran quickly to the garret, sprang
to the beam where he had tucked the precious
document, and then set up a “maou” of
anger and dismay. The mice had nibbled the
valuable parchment into tiny scraps!</p>

<p>Tomcat vowed, then and there, that no
mouse should escape his claws from that day
on.</p>

<p>The King of the Dogs sent Tomcat away in
disgrace, and the dogs agreed that thereafter
they would chase a cat whenever they should
see one.</p>

<p>But, Dog Trophy lost his roast of beef.</p>

<h4>The Miser of Takhoma<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></h4>

<p>Long, long ago, Miser lived near the foot
of Takhoma. He never was happy. When
food was scarce and the tribe were starving,
Miser could find fish in secret places in the
streams. When the snows were deep and the
black-necked elk hid in the dark places of the
forest, he could still secure meat. His skill<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
as a hunter and fisherman was known to all
his tribe. But Miser cared only for hiaqua,
or shell money. Now Moosmoos, the elk, was
Miser’s tomanowos, or guardian spirit.
Therefore, he tried to talk with the elk, even
while hunting them. He wanted more
hiaqua.</p>

<p class="tb">One night Moosmoos whispered to Miser
the secret hiding-place of the hiaqua of the
tomanowos. The hiding-place was high up
on Takhoma. Early in the morning, Miser
began to make ready for his search. He sent
his klootchman, or squaw, to dig camas
roots. Thus he could work secretly. He
made two elk-horn picks by taking off all the
prongs except the upper ones. He filled his
ikta, or bag, with kinnikinnick, and with dried
salmon. At sunset Miser began to climb the
mountain.</p>

<p>All night he climbed the trail. All the
next day he climbed. By night again he was
above the snow line, cold and tired and hungry.
When the moon arose, he climbed again.
Over vast snow fields, across wide cracks in
the ice, over the slippery shoulders of the
lower peaks he climbed. At sunrise he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
reached the top. Now Takhoma was the
home of the tomanowos, therefore, Miser was
afraid. But Moosmoos had told him where
the hiaqua was hidden.</p>

<p>In the white snow field which covered the
crater was a black lake. Beyond it were
three stones of equal height, all as tall as a
giant. The top of the first was shaped like
a salmon’s head, the top of the second was
like a camas root, and the third like an elk’s
head. Then Miser believed the voice of
Moosmoos.</p>

<p>Miser threw down his ikta. He unwrapped
his elk-horn pick. Then he began to dig in
the snow at the foot of the elk’s head.</p>

<p>Miser struck the first blow. As an echo
he heard a sudden puff. Startled, he turned
to see a huge otter climbing out of the black
waters of the lake. Big Otter struck his tail
with a loud thump on the snow. Another
otter appeared, then another. At last twelve
otters gathered in a circle around their huge
leader. They formed a circle around Miser,
digging with his pick at the foot of the elk’s
head. Then Big Otter leaped to the top of
the elk’s head. All the others gave a loud
puff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>Miser kept digging. At every thirteenth
blow of the pick Big Otter thumped with
his tail on the elk’s head. Then the circle
of twelve thumped with theirs on the snow.</p>

<p>Miser became tired and stopped digging
for a moment. Big Otter turned on the elk’s
head. With his tail he struck Miser on the
shoulder. Then the twelve turned, walked
backward, and struck him with their tails.
Miser began to dig again.</p>

<p>As he dug in the rock, his pick broke. Big
Otter jumped from the elk’s head. He seized
the second pick in his mouth and gave it to
him.</p>

<p>Miser dared not stop. With each thirteenth
blow of the pick and the thump of
the tails, the otters came nearer. He could
feel their breath as he lifted the last stone.
Beneath lay a great hole, filled with hiaqua.
As he lifted out the shells, the otters returned
to their larger circle.</p>

<p>Miser lifted out handful after handful of
the shell money. He strung the hiaqua on elk
sinews, twenty strings in all. The rest he
covered again. He hurried, for it was after
noon and he must return below the snow line.
Then Miser left the elk’s head. He offered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
no shells to Moosmoos or to Sahale. He had
forgotten the tomanowos.</p>

<p>As he crossed the crater, the otters, one
by one, with a loud puff, jumped into the
black lake. They began to beat the black
water with their tails. He heard them beat
the water as he plunged through the snow
to the edge of the crater. Miser felt that the
shells were very heavy.</p>

<p>As he stepped over the edge of the crater,
he glanced hack. The three stones had vanished.
A thick mist rose from the black
waters of the lake. Under the mist was a
black cloud, hiding the water. Miser feared
tomanowos in the clouds.</p>

<p>Then the storm seized him. It flung him
over an ice bank. The blackness of all darkness
lay around him. Colenass, the storm
god, came down upon the mountain. Tootah,
the thunder, deafened him with its roar. The
storm crashed about him. Fiery blasts
melted the snow into great torrents. Icy
winds froze them solid again. In the roar
and thunder, Miser heard the voices of all
the tomanowos, “Ha, ha, hiaqua! Ha, ha,
hiaqua!”</p>

<p>Miser threw away a string of hiaqua. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
storm slackened for a moment. Then all began
louder than ever. Kakahete screamed,
“Ha, ha, hiaqua! Ha, ha, hiaqua!”</p>

<p>One by one Miser threw away the strings
of hiaqua, strung on the sinews of Moosmoos,
the elk. Always the tomanowos screamed
after him. Then when the last string was
gone, with a last gust the storm blew him
down, flat upon the ground.</p>

<p>Miser slept a long time. When he awoke,
Takhoma glistened above him, shining white
in the sunlight. All around him grew camas
roots. Rocky ridges lay where once the forest
had stretched. Sunny meadows lay
around him. Miser stretched himself and
arose. Only dry leaves and dead grass remained
in the rotted ikta. Miser wondered.
Then he went down the mountain side. He
ate berries for food until he came to a cabin
in the valley. There lived a very old woman.
He talked with her and found she was his
klootchman. Klootchman said he had slept
thirty snows. Miser looked at himself in a
pool. He was very old. His hair was white.
Many, many snows had the angry tomanowos
made him sleep. But Miser was happy. He
no longer cared for hiaqua.</p>

<h4>Little Sister Kindness and the Loving Stitches<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></h4>

<p>Once, when the world was new, there lived
a beautiful princess whose father was the
King of Forgotten Land. The King loved
his daughter very much, but he was a very
wise King; the more he loved the Princess,
the more he realized that she must learn
obedience, and many other hard lessons.</p>

<p>The King knew that if he allowed his little
daughter to be worshipped as many Princesses
are, her face would grow hard and
full of ugly lines, so the wee Princess was
taught to divide her treasures, and to care
for the poor in her father’s kingdom. And
so, instead of growing hard and selfish, the
King’s daughter grew lovelier every day, and
she was known as Princess Tender-heart.</p>

<p>At last, when the Princess had grown,
there came a Prince from the land of Bye-and-Bye,
to marry the Princess Tender-heart.
For a wedding gift he presented her with
five hundred and forty-three mansions, surrounding
his palace. And the Princess was
to give these mansions to the friends she
loved best, so that she should not be lonely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
when she went with the Prince to live in the
land of Bye-and-Bye.</p>

<p>But one day the King found his daughter
very unhappy, and when he begged her to
tell him why she was in tears, she said that
she had given away five hundred and forty-two
mansions, but she still had many friends,
and she did not know what to do with the one
mansion that remained. It was the one which
stood the very nearest to the palace of the
Prince.</p>

<p>Then the wise King said, “There, there!
We’ll settle this matter easily. That one
home shall go to the one who loves you best.”</p>

<p>“But how—,” began the Princess.</p>

<p>“Never mind how,” interrupted her
father, and then they both laughed so merrily
that all the canary birds in the kingdom
began to sing.</p>

<p>The very next day the King of Forgotten
Land issued a proclamation which set all the
people to talking.</p>

<p>Among those who read the copy that was
posted outside the palace gates was a maiden
known as Little Sister Kindness.</p>

<p>“So the Princess is to be married one
month from today,” she exclaimed. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
turning, she saw a blind man standing by,
who had no one with him to tell him what the
King’s message contained.</p>

<p>Little Sister Kindness stepped to his side,
and explained to him the contents of the
proclamation.</p>

<p>“The Princess Tender-heart is to be married,”
she said, “and instead of having her
wedding garments made by the court dressmaker,
the King wishes everyone who loves
the Princess to come to the palace and help
make her clothes. To the one whose work
proves that she loves the Princess best, shall
be given the finest gift house of the five hundred
and forty-three presented by the Prince
of Bye-and-Bye.”</p>

<p>“I beg you to tell me more,” urged the
blind man. “My daughter is a dressmaker.
How shall it be known who best loves the
Princess?”</p>

<p>“How fortunate that your daughter is a
dressmaker!” exclaimed Little Sister Kindness.
“I wish that I were a dressmaker, too.
The King announces that by examining the
wardrobe when it is completed he will know
at a glance who best loves Her Royal Highness.
Everyone adores the Princess, so only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
by magic will the King know who loves her
best.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” the blind man said with a
low bow. “I must hasten now to tell my
daughter this good news.”</p>

<p>“And I must hasten, too,” agreed Little
Sister Kindness, “for I have many friends
who are skillful with the needle, and I must
carry the news to each one.”</p>

<p>From that hour the sewing room of the
palace became a busy, bustling place. For
the seamstresses, and the embroiderers, and
the lace-makers came from all parts of the
kingdom, to sew upon the wardrobe of the
Princess Tender-heart.</p>

<p>One day, a week later, Little Sister Kindness
called at the palace with a message for
a friend who was a noted lace-maker. And
while she waited she watched the busy workers,
and heard them talking. It did not take
her long to discover that each worker was
striving to make some great piece of work
which should attract the attention of the
King, and that each was eager to secure the
most showy garment to work upon. She saw,
too, that the lace-makers used knots in the
end of the threads, and that the stitches which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
would not show, were carelessly made and
finished.</p>

<p>Finally, Little Sister Kindness became so
distressed by what she saw in the workroom
that she begged to stay.</p>

<p>“But, what can you do?” inquired the
manager of the wardrobe.</p>

<p>“Nothing that will count,” replied Little
Sister Kindness, “but I can tie loose ends of
threads, and darn little holes neatly, and finish
seams inside and—”</p>

<p>“There, there!” exclaimed the manager
of the wardrobe. “Do get a needle and begin.
I have been so worried lest the Princess
should not have one perfect garment.”</p>

<p>So Little Sister Kindness began her work
and was soon the busiest maiden in the palace.
Scarcely a garment escaped her loving
fingers. Everything needed a little stitch
here and a little stitch there; a button and
button-hole in place of a pin; a bit of trimming
to be firmly fastened; a bow to be
sewed securely in place; always a stitch here
and a stitch there; never a piece of work that
would show; not so much as a collar or a
belt that the King might say, “Ah! This
was made by Little Sister Kindness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>There were days when the maiden felt discouraged
and wished that she, too, might be
doing something worth while for love of the
beautiful Princess. But the unfinished seams
and the hastily caught bows kept her too
busy to grow dissatisfied, and she knew that
she was not skillful enough to fashion beautiful
garments, or make filmy bits of lace.</p>

<p>At last, when the wardrobe was completed,
the King gave a banquet to which all in the
kingdom were invited. Then, in the presence
of his subjects, he walked into the great hall
where all the wardrobe was displayed. Some
of the garments were of linen, some of silk,
some of satin, and others of lace; and when
the King appeared each robe began to glow
with a soft light, and to shine with a hundred
little stars; here a star and there a star.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” exclaimed all the people, “oh,
oh, oh! There are tiny gold stitches shining
like stars on every garment. Why do
those stitches shine like golden stars? Who
put them there? Whose are the golden
stitches?”</p>

<p>“Those are the stitches of the one who
loves the Princess best!” the King made
answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>Then came a low wondering murmur from
all who had worked upon the royal wardrobe,
and the murmur sounded like sweet music
that sang over and over:</p>

<p>“Little Sister Kindness! It is Little Sister
Kindness!”</p>

<p>So it came about that Little Sister Kindness
and her family went to live in the home
that was nearest the palace of the Prince
and Princess in Bye-and-Bye, and there they
all lived happily ever after.</p>

<h4>The Queen’s Necklace<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></h4>

<p>Once upon a time there lived an old king
whom you could not very well call good, in
fact he was very disagreeable and horrid.</p>

<p>Now, in his old age, the king had a fancy
for marrying and he cast his eye over his
many kingdoms to spy out a suitable wife
for himself.</p>

<p>In this way his eye fell upon quite a young
princess who was called Blanzeflor.</p>

<p>“She is as fair as a sunny day, as mild as a
dove, and as meek as a lamb, and she is only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
seventeen years old, too! She will suit me
admirably,” said the king.</p>

<p>But when her father came to her and said:</p>

<p>“Blanzeflor, our sovereign lord, the king,
would have you for his queen,” she wept and
said she would rather sit upon a stone and
spin goats’ wool, than sit as queen at <i>that</i>
king’s side.</p>

<p>But when her father said that she must
realize that if she refused the king he would
come and hang both her father and mother
and all the family upon a tree like so many
bunches of onions, then the princess bowed
her head and said, “Then I will marry him.”</p>

<p>So they clad her in silk and in gold, and
set a crown upon her head and combed her
long golden hair over her shoulders, then
they lifted her upon a white palfrey and rode
forth with her to the king, and thus the wedding
took place.</p>

<p>On her wedding day the king hung a necklace
of pearls around her neck.</p>

<p>“I threaded them myself on this silken
cord,” said the king. “These are pearls of
the East and there are three hundred and
sixty-five of them, the smallest being a little
crooked; and I warn you,” he added, “take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
great care of them, for on the day you lose
the necklace, I warrant you will not care to
look me in the eyes;” and the king began
to roll his eyes so horribly that the young
queen felt cold shivers all down her spine.
Thus Blanzeflor became queen.</p>

<p>Every morning the king ate porridge and
cream in bed, and the queen carried it to
him in a golden bowl and fed him like a baby,
for such was his command. Every evening
the king and queen would play chess, and
then the queen always had to let the king
win, otherwise he would get bad-tempered.</p>

<p>But the very worst was at mealtime, for the
king was so proud he would not let anyone
sit at table with the queen and himself. The
young queen would sit with downcast eyes,
scarcely daring to swallow a morsel, so
greatly did she tremble for fear lest something
should displease the king, for then he
became quite terrible.</p>

<p>The only pleasure the court had was to
stand and stare at Blanzeflor, for she glowed
with a beauty more bright and radiant than
all the torchlights in the banqueting hall, and
when she bowed and smiled it warmed the
heart like the sun in summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>Now, dreadful stories came to the queen’s
ears of how the king would fling people into
prison for the smallest offence, or wring their
necks like chickens; but alas! what could she
do in the matter? She, herself, sat like a
prisoner in the royal castle, and never was
she allowed to go out on foot but only on
horseback followed by a royal retinue and
closely guarded.</p>

<p>It happened one day, however, that the
queen was in church—there at least the king
could not prevent her from going—and as
she knelt in prayer before the high altar, she
noticed how meanly and poorly God’s holy
altar was adorned.</p>

<p>Then the queen wept bitterly and said to
herself: “I drink out of golden goblets, and
silver torches are lighted on my table, but
upon God’s altar the candlesticks are of
pewter and the velvet cloth which covers the
Lord’s table is all faded and patched. I cannot
bear to see it.” And thereupon she
slowly and carefully unclasped her necklace,
drew off seven of the largest pearls and
laid them upon the altar.</p>

<p>That evening she had her hair combed back
and fastened in a knot upon her neck, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
that the king might not see that the pearls
were missing.</p>

<p>Now it happened one night that the queen
lay awake. She could not sleep because she
thought she heard strange sounds of sighing
and sobbing out in the night. It all sounded
so piteous and heartrending that the queen
wept upon her silken pillow. “Here I lie
upon my bed of satin,” she sighed, “whilst
outside, perhaps little children go barefooted
in the snow. I cannot bear to think of it.”</p>

<p>There was a sound of twittering and chirping,
and now she saw how one little half-frozen
bird after another flew up and tapped
upon the window-pane with its beak, in search
of a chance grain of corn.</p>

<p>“Alas, alas!” sighed the queen, “I eat
roast venison out of a golden dish and drink
mulled wine, and there outside the poor little
birds starve to death in the cold. I cannot
bear to think of it;” and the next day she
begged leave of the king to collect the crumbs
after meals and to place them in a basket outside
her window for the birds.</p>

<p>Well, of course the king thought it was
asking a good deal, but as the queen never
begged for anything for herself, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
crumbs were, after all, of not much use for
anything else, he allowed her to take them,
and from that day the queen always sat and
rolled bread between her white fingers during
meals, and crumbled one little piece after another
into little bits, whilst she chatted and
jested with the king, so that he might not
pay any heed to what she was doing, and
when she rose from the table she would sign
to her page, and then he would brush all the
crumbs into a small basket which was hung
outside the queen’s chamber window, and at
sunrise she was always awakened by the
chirping of the small hungry birds when they
came to empty her basket.</p>

<p>Now it happened one morning when the
queen took in her basket to have it refilled,
that she thought she saw a large snowflake
lying at the bottom, but it was really a little
piece of paper which had been folded around
a small stone and thrown up at the window,
and on it was written an appealing tale of
misery.</p>

<p>“The queen who takes pity upon the starving
birds of the air,” it said, “will surely
take pity upon the starving children upon
earth;” and the queen read it over and over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
again, whilst her tears fell like rain in
spring.</p>

<p>But, how could she help them? At last she
hit upon a plan.</p>

<p>The king had given the queen a page, who
was as young and beautiful as herself. He
carried her long velvet train embroidered
with golden crowns, he filled her goblet with
wine, and lit the torch which was to light
her upon her way through the dark passages
of the castle, and he slept on a bear skin
outside her door with his drawn sword beside
him to protect her from all harm and
danger.</p>

<p>Now when the page came to carry the train
of her sky-blue velvet gown, the queen bent
down as if to adjust it, and at the same time
she slipped a little piece of paper into the
page’s hand. In it she had placed one of the
pearls from off her necklace, and had written
down where she wished him to carry it.</p>

<p>Away he flew as swiftly as a swallow, and
when he took up the queen’s train again that
evening, he placed his hands upon his breast
and bowed in silence, but the queen could
read in his face that his errand had well
sped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>From that day prayers and petitions simply
rained down upon the queen’s window-sill.</p>

<p>What could she do but take the pearls from
her necklace? And so with trembling hands
she drew off one pearl after another, and
finally one morning there was not a single
pearl left.</p>

<p>The king was not in a good temper at dinner
that day, and he saw that the necklace
was missing!</p>

<p>“Where is the necklace?” he shrieked.
His voice sounded like the caw of a hoarse
old crow. “Where is the necklace?”</p>

<p>The queen looked confused.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have not got it on today,” she
said. But the king had her eight tire-women
and her eight ladies-in-waiting called up, and
they had to search over and over through all
the queen’s drawers and presses, till they
were as red as cranberries, but the necklace
was not to be found.</p>

<p>“Have you lost the necklace?” roared the
king.</p>

<p>“No,” said the queen, timidly.</p>

<p>“Have you given it away?” shouted the
king. “To whom have you given it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>The queen dropped her eyelids and said
nothing.</p>

<p>Then the king had the queen thrown into
prison; there she was to remain until the
necklace was found.</p>

<p>Now you can imagine what a hurly-burly
there was after this. The king in front, with
six attendants at his heels, searched the whole
castle from garret to cellar. But still the
necklace was not to be found.</p>

<p>Alas for the queen, poor young Blanzeflor!
She sat in the darkest of dungeons. No one
could get to her.</p>

<p>She fell on her knees upon the straw lying
on the prison floor, and prayed to God
that he might perform a miracle and set the
guiltless free.</p>

<p>“Thou, O God, canst break through prison
walls as easily as the sun breaks through the
mists,” she said. “Thou canst also set an
innocent prisoner free.”</p>

<p>But scarcely had she ended her prayer
when she saw in the pale morning light how
the thick prison walls fell apart, and between
them came a swallow flying, as easily
and as quickly as if it were merely flying
through the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>In its beak it held a white pearl, which it
dropped upon the queen’s knees.</p>

<p>“This is one of the tears you shed before
the high altar,” twittered the swallow, “God
gives it you back in the likeness of a pearl.”</p>

<p>At the same moment came another swallow
through the wall, and another and another,
and in a twinkling the whole prison
was filled with a flight of birds.</p>

<p>Each had a white pearl in its beak, which it
laid upon Blanzeflor’s lap.</p>

<p>“Here are the tears you shed for those
who were poor and sad at heart,” they
chirped; “not one has fallen in vain.”</p>

<p>At last came a little bird with a maimed
wing; in its beak was the little crooked pearl,
for this, too, had been threaded on the necklace.</p>

<p>Blanzeflor sat perfectly still and let the
pearls lie upon her knees, for she could not
touch them with her fettered hands. Then
the sun rose red in the East and shone into
the prison so that it streamed with light
like heaven itself.</p>

<p>But just then the king came in with all
his retinue. He had come to take the queen
away to be beheaded. But when he saw her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
sitting with a halo of light around her and
with the pearls in her lap, he stood stock-still
with amazement. Then he began to
count the pearls, and every single one was
there, all three hundred and sixty-five, even
to the little crooked one! But the silken
cord on which they had been strung was
missing.</p>

<p>Away went the king hobbling up the stairs
to his own apartments to fetch a new silken
cord. He was afraid to ask anyone else to go
for it because he feared they would steal
something.</p>

<p>When the king had snipped off his cord
he hurried back so quickly down to the prison
again, that he tripped over his own feet and
fell and broke his neck, and there he lay
dead on his way down to the dungeons where
he had let so many innocent people suffer and
pine to death.</p>

<p>The king was buried, and the queen was
proclaimed the only reigning sovereign in all
the land.</p>

<p>And never was there a gentler queen than
she. If any one was in any trouble or distress
they simply said:</p>

<p>“We shall go to the queen, there is sure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
to be one more pearl left on her Majesty’s
necklace!”</p>

<h4>Robin Hood and Sir Richard-at-the-Lee<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></h4>

<p>Listen, and I will tell you about a good
yeoman whose name was Robin Hood. All
his life he was a proud outlaw, but so courteous
an outlaw as he was never found, and
he would never do any harm to a company
in which there was a woman, for he held all
women in great respect and honor.</p>

<p>Now one day Robin Hood stood in the forest
of Barnsdale and leant against a tree,
and beside him stood his good yeoman, Little
John, and Scarlet also, and Much, the miller’s
son.</p>

<p>Then Little John spoke to Robin, saying:
“Master, ’tis time to dine.”</p>

<p>But Robin answered, “I will not dine till
I have some bold baron or a knight or a
squire with me who will pay for his dinner.”</p>

<p>Then Little John and Much and William
Scarlet set out in search of a guest, and after
a time they saw a knight riding towards them
with his retinue. He made but a sorry appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
and seemed to have lost his pride,
for he had but one foot in the stirrup, and
his hood hung down over his eyes, and his
clothes and trappings were mean and old.</p>

<p>But Little John showed him courtesy, and
knelt before him saying:</p>

<p>“Welcome, gentle knight; welcome to the
greenwood. My master has been waiting for
you, fasting these three hours.”</p>

<p>“Who is your master?” asked the knight;
and John answered, “Robin Hood.”</p>

<p>“He is a good yeoman,” said the knight,
“and I have heard men speak well of him.”</p>

<p>So the knight, whose name was Sir
Richard-at-the-Lee, rode on his way with
Little John, till they came to where Robin
was waiting; and Robin took off his hood
and went on his knee, saying, courteously:</p>

<p>“Welcome, Sir Knight. I have awaited
thee these three hours.”</p>

<p>And the gentle knight replied with fair
words:</p>

<p>“God save thee, good Robin, and all thy
company.”</p>

<p>When they had thus exchanged greetings,
they washed and wiped their hands, and sat
them down to their dinner. They had bread<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
and wine and venison, with swans and
pheasants and many other birds. And Robin
bade the knight make good cheer, and the
knight thanked him heartily.</p>

<p>“For,” said he, “I have not had such
a dinner for three weeks; and if I come this
way again, Robin, I will give thee as good
a dinner as thou hast given me.”</p>

<p>“I thank thee, knight,” said Robin; “but
methinks it is right that thou shouldst pay
ere thou goest. It was never the custom,
by Heaven, for a yeoman to pay for a
knight.”</p>

<p>But Sir Richard answered, “I have naught
in my coffers that I can offer thee for very
shame. I have but ten shillings.”</p>

<p>To this Robin answered, “If thou hast no
more, I will not take a penny; and if thou
hast need of more I will lend it to thee.”</p>

<p>Then he called to Little John:</p>

<p>“Go forth and see if there are but ten
shillings in the knight’s mantle.”</p>

<p>So Little John spread the mantle on the
ground and searched in it; and he found but
ten shillings as the knight had said.</p>

<p>Now Robin wondered at this, and said to
Sir Richard:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>“Surely thou must have been made a
knight against thy will, if thou art so poor;
or else thou hast been a bad husbandman, or
a usurer, of hast done some evil or other.”</p>

<p>But the knight replied:</p>

<p>“I am none of these. My ancestors have
been knights before me for a hundred years.
But it has often happened that a knight has
been disgraced through no fault of his own.
Two years ago, Robin, I could spend four
hundred pounds yearly, and my neighbors
will bear me witness of this. But now, alas!
it has come to pass that I have no property
whatsoever.”</p>

<p>“And in what manner,” asked Robin,
“didst thou lose thy riches?”</p>

<p>Then Sir Richard told Robin how his son
had slain a knight in a joust, and how to save
him he had put his lands in pawn to a rich
abbot whose abbey was near at hand. The
sum he had to pay to redeem them was four
hundred pounds, and since he could not pay
it, there was nothing left for him to do but
to forfeit his lands and go on a pilgrimage
to the Holy Land. For the men who had
boasted of their friendship towards him when
he was rich had now deserted him, so that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
could find no one who was now willing to lend
him any money.</p>

<p>Robin and his followers were moved to
great pity by this tale, and Robin sent Little
John to his treasury to fetch four hundred
pounds to give to the knight. Then Little
John cried:</p>

<p>“Master, his apparel is full thin. Ye must
give the knight a suit of clothes, for ye have
scarlet and green-colored cloth in plenty, and
there is no merchant in merry England so
rich as ye are!”</p>

<p>“Give him three yards of each color,” said
Robin, “and see you measure it fairly.”</p>

<p>So Little John took his bow as a measure
and measured out the cloth, and then he
turned to Robin Hood, saying:</p>

<p>“Master, ye must give the knight a horse
to carry home all this cloth.”</p>

<p>So Robin gave the knight a grey courser
and a new saddle, and Much added a good
palfrey, and Scarlet a pair of boots, and
Little John a pair of gilt spurs.</p>

<p>Then the knight asked what day he should
come back to pay his debt, and Robin appointed
that day twelve-month. And as a
last act of kindness, he sent his trusty yeoman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
Little John, to attend his guest on his
journey. So Sir Richard went on his way
rejoicing and blessing Robin Hood; and he
redeemed his lands from the abbot’s hands,
and then returned home to his castle, and began
to collect money against the day when
he should return to pay Robin Hood the four
hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Now the year went by and the appointed
day came, but the knight did not appear, because
as he rode on his way to the trysting-place
he had turned aside for the love of
Robin to help a poor yeoman who was not
receiving fair play in a wrestling match at
some country games. When Robin found,
therefore, that the knight did not come, he
sent forth Little John, Scarlet, and Much, to
seek another guest to dine with him, one who
would be able to pay him four hundred
pounds; for though he would never rob a
poor man, he did not think it wrong to make
the rich pay poor men’s debts.</p>

<p>Before long the three trusty yeomen saw a
monk riding towards them, followed by a retinue
of fifty men, with seven strong pack-horses
bearing his riches, and Little John
cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>“Brethren, I dare lay my life that this is
the man who shall pay our master; and
though we are but three against so many, we
must bring him to dinner, or we cannot go
back to Robin Hood.”</p>

<p>Then he called to the monk:</p>

<p>“Abide, and come no farther, for if thou
dost I shall slay thee. Thou hast made our
master wroth, because he has waited for thee
fasting for so long.”</p>

<p>“Who is your master?” asked the monk.</p>

<p>“Robin Hood.”</p>

<p>“He is a thief,” said the monk, “and I
have never heard aught good of him.”</p>

<p>But Little John answered:</p>

<p>“Thou liest, and thou shalt repent it. He
is a yeoman of the forest, and has bidden
thee to dine with him.”</p>

<p>Then the yeomen drew their bows, and
Much pointed his arrow straight at the
monk’s breast.</p>

<p>At this all his followers turned and fled,
save only a little page and a groom, who led
the pack-horses to Robin Hood, while Much
and Little John took the monk in custody between
them to their master.</p>

<p>When Robin saw the monk he raised his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
hood; but the monk was not so courteous,
and did not return the greeting.</p>

<p>Then Robin summoned his yeomen, and
they prepared the meal, and served the monk
with his dinner; and afterwards Robin asked,
as was his custom, how much his guest had
in his coffers.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the monk, “but twenty
pounds, as I hope to prosper.”</p>

<p>“If there is no more,” said Robin, “I
will not take a penny; and if thou hast need
of more I will lend it thee. But if I find more
than twenty pounds thou wilt have to give
it up.”</p>

<p>So Robin sent Little John to search the
monk’s mantle and there he found over eight
hundred pounds. At this Robin rejoiced, for
it was twice the sum that he needed to repay
him for what he had generously lent the
knight.</p>

<p>But the monk was very wroth, and cried:</p>

<p>“By Heaven, ’tis no courtesy to bid a man
to dinner and then treat him so ill.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless it is an old custom of ours
to leave but little behind for our guests to
take away with them,” said Robin.</p>

<p>Then the monk put spurs to his horse, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
he feared to stay longer. But Robin cried
after him:</p>

<p>“Will you not have a drink of wine before
you go?”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said the monk, “I would I had
never come near you, for I should have dined
far more cheaply at Blyth or Doncaster.”</p>

<p>“Greet well your abbot and your prior for
me,” Robin called back, “and bid them send
me such a monk as you to dinner every day.”</p>

<p>So the monk rode away, leaving all his
riches behind him; and now at last the knight
came riding into the greenwood, with all his
merry company. When he saw Robin he
alighted from his palfrey, doffed his hood,
and fell on his knee, saying:</p>

<p>“God save thee, Robin Hood, and all this
company.”</p>

<p>“Welcome be thou, gentle knight,” Robin
answered. “Hast thou thy land again?”</p>

<p>“Yea,” said the knight, “and I thank
Heaven and thee for it. But take it not amiss
that I am come so late, for I have been at
a wrestling match, where I helped a poor yeoman
who was not getting fair play in the
game.”</p>

<p>“Sir knight,” Robin answered, “I thank<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
thee. Whoever helps a good yeoman will
always be my friend.”</p>

<p>Now, when they had thus greeted each
other the knight said:</p>

<p>“Here is thy four hundred pounds which
thou didst lend me, and twenty pounds more
for thy courtesy.”</p>

<p>“Nay, by Heaven,” cried Robin, “thou
shalt keep it for thyself, for I have already
received the money for the debt, and it would
be a disgrace to take it twice.” And he told
the knight the story of the monk, and they
laughed together over it and made good
cheer.</p>

<p>Thus Robin Hood helped the knight out of
all his troubles and they were friends from
that time to the end of their days.</p>

<h4>How the Queen of the Sky Gave Gifts to Men<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></h4>

<p>By the side of All-Father Odin, upon his
high seat in Asgard, sat Frigga, his wife,
the Queen of the Asas. Sometimes she would
be dressed in snow-white garments, bound at
the waist by a golden girdle, from which hung
a great bunch of golden keys. And the earth-dwellers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
gazing into the sky, would admire
the great white clouds as they floated across
the blue, not perceiving that these clouds were
really the folds of Frigga’s flowing white
robe, as it waved in the wind.</p>

<p>At other times she would wear dark gray
or purple garments; and then the earth-dwellers
made haste into their houses, for
they said, “The sky is lowering today, and
a storm is nigh at hand.”</p>

<p>Frigga had a palace of her own called
Fensalir, or the Hall of Mists, where she
spent much of her time at her wheel spinning
golden thread, or weaving web after web of
many-colored clouds. All night long she sat
at this golden wheel, and if you look at the
sky on a starry night you may chance to see
it set up where the men of the South show
a constellation called the Girdle of Orion.</p>

<p>Frigga was especially interested in all good
housewives, and she herself set them an excellent
example in Fensalir. When the snow-flakes
fell, the earth-dwellers knew it was
Frigga shaking her great feather bed, and
when it rained they said it was her washing
day. It was she who first gave to them the
gift of flax that the women upon earth might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
spin, and weave, and bleach their linen as
white as the clouds of her own white robe.</p>

<p>And this is how it came about:</p>

<p>There was once a shepherd who lived
among the mountains with his wife and children;
and so very poor was he that he often
found it hard to give his family enough to
satisfy their hunger. But he did not grumble;
he only worked the harder; and his
wife, though she had scarcely any furniture,
and never a chance of a new dress, kept the
house so clean, and the old clothes so well
mended, that, all unknown to herself, she rose
high in the favor of the all-seeing Frigga.</p>

<p>Now one day, when the shepherd had driven
his few poor sheep up the mountain to pasture,
a fine reindeer sprang from the rocks
above him and began to leap upward along
the steep slope. The shepherd snatched up
his crossbow and pursued the animal, thinking
to himself: “Now we shall have a better
meal than we have had for many a long
day.”</p>

<p>Up and up leaped the reindeer, always just
out of reach, and at length disappeared behind
a great boulder just as the shepherd
breathless and weary, reached the spot. No<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
sign of the reindeer was to be seen, but, on
looking around, the shepherd saw that he
was among the snowy heights of the mountains,
and almost at the top of a great
glacier.</p>

<p>Presently, as he pursued his vain search
for the animal, he saw to his amazement an
open door, leading apparently into the heart
of the glacier. He was a fearless man, and
so, without hesitation, he passed boldly
through the doorway and found himself
standing in a marvelous cavern, lit up by
blazing torches which gleamed upon rich
jewels hanging from the roof and walls. And
in the midst stood a woman, most fair to
behold, clad in snow-white robes and surrounded
by a group of lovely maidens.</p>

<p>The shepherd’s boldness gave way at this
awesome sight, and he sank to his knees
before the Asa, Frigga, for she it was. But
Frigga bade him be of good cheer, and said:
“Choose now whatsoever you will to carry
away with you as a remembrance of this
place.”</p>

<p>The shepherd’s eyes wandered over the
glittering jewels on the walls and roof, but
they came back to a little bunch of blue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
flowers which Frigga held in her hand. They
alone looked homelike to him; the rest were
hard and cold; so he asked timidly that he
might be given the little nosegay.</p>

<p>Then Frigga smiled kindly upon him.</p>

<p>“Most wise has been your choice,” said
she. “Take with the flowers this measure
of seed and sow it in your field, and you
shall grow flowers of your own. They shall
bring prosperity to you and yours.”</p>

<p>So the shepherd took the flowers and the
seed, and scarcely had he done so when a
mighty peal of thunder, followed by the shock
of an earthquake, rent the cavern, and when
he had collected his sense he found himself
once more upon the mountain side.</p>

<p>When he reached home and had told his
tale, his wife scolded him roundly for not
bringing home a jewel which would have
made them rich forever. But when she
would have thrown the flowers away he prevented
her. Next day he sowed the seed in
his field, and was surprised to find how far
it went.</p>

<p>Very soon after this the field was thick
with tiny green shoots; and though his wife
reproached him for wasting good ground<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
upon useless flowers, he watched and waited
in hope until the field was blue with the starry
flax blooms.</p>

<p>Then one night, when the flowers had
withered and the seed was ripe, Frigga, in
the disguise of an old woman, visited the
lowly hut and showed the shepherd and his
astonished wife how to use the flax stalks;
how to spin them into thread, and how to
weave the thread into linen.</p>

<p>It was not long before all the dwellers in
that part of the earth had heard of the wonderful
material, and were hurrying to the
shepherd’s hut to buy the bleached linen or
the seed from which it was obtained. And
so the shepherd and his family were soon
among the richest people in the land; and
the promise of Frigga was amply fulfilled.</p>

<h4>King Midas’ Ears<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></h4>

<p>Once upon a time King Midas—the very
same King Midas who had been cured of his
hated golden touch—was invited to hear
some very wonderful music. It came about
in this wise:</p>

<p>After King Midas had been cured of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
golden touch, he loved to wander in the woods
and fields, away from all sight of the wealth
of men, and of the splendors that wealth
could buy. In this way he became a great
friend of Pan, who ruled over the woods and
fields, and over the shepherds and their
flocks.</p>

<p>Now Pan had invented the shepherd’s flute,
which was made from a reed, and upon which
he could play better than could anyone else.
It was a very simple instrument: one that
could produce only simple melodies. But
after Pan had learned to play upon it well,
he began to think that his pastoral tunes were
wonderfully fine, and at last he imagined
that they were quite equal to the harmonies
even of Apollo, who was master of the art
of music, and a matchless player upon a
stringed instrument called the lyre.</p>

<p>King Midas, as he walked about the groves
and pastures with Pan, listened with pleasure
to the music of his pipe, and praised him
so warmly that Pan’s self-conceit grew
beyond all bounds. He thought his simple
music equal to that of the gods.</p>

<p>At length Pan sent a challenge to Apollo,
asking him to meet him and let it be decided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
by the listeners who was the greater musician
of the two.</p>

<p>Apollo accepted the challenge, and at the
appointed time the people gathered in great
numbers, for such a meeting had never been
heard of before.</p>

<p>Among the listeners was King Midas.</p>

<p>Pan was the first to play. He stepped
forth, clad all in green to match the verdure
of the meadows and of the trees, over which
he ruled.</p>

<p>He put his simple pipe of reeds to his lips
and began playing, and the people listened
with great interest and pleasure, for surely
no one dreamed that such music could come
from the shepherd’s pipe.</p>

<p>But when Pan had finished, Apollo stepped
forth. He was clad in royal purple, and his
cloak was thrown back that his right arm
might be free.</p>

<p>He struck the strings of the lyre, and the
music that fell upon the air was so marvelously
sweet, so full of pathos, so full of ravishing
beauty, that all the people were moved
by the sound. Then they applauded Apollo,
and laughed to scorn the boastful challenge
of Pan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>“Ho, ho,” they cried, “does Pan think
that he can match such melody as this?”</p>

<p>But King Midas was faithful to his friend,
and, unconvinced by Apollo’s wondrous
music, he declared that Pan was the better
player of the two.</p>

<p>Apollo, wearing the laurel wreath as his
crown of victory, declared that the ears of
King Midas must be depraved, and, that they
should thereafter take on a form more in
keeping with the taste of their owner.</p>

<p>King Midas had no sooner reached his
castle than he felt a strange sensation about
his ears; and the strange feeling increased
until at length, putting his hands to the sides
of his head, he found with terror that his ears
had grown long and were covered inside and
outside with hair, and he could move them
about, just as a donkey moves his. In fact,
he found that they had become exactly like
the ears of a donkey, or an ass.</p>

<p>King Midas was overcome with shame and
rage, and he kept himself hidden from all
the people.</p>

<p>After a time it occurred to him that he
could have a turban or head-dress made which
would cover his monstrous deformity. So he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
summoned a hair-dresser, of great skill in his
trade, and when the hair-dresser had finished
his task, King Midas was ready to go forth
among his people again, for his ears were
quite hidden from sight under the ample folds
of his head-dress.</p>

<p>Only the hair-dresser knew his secret, and
he had promised never to tell it to a living
being.</p>

<p>But as the days went by, the secret began
to burn in the hair-dresser’s mind, and it
was with the greatest difficulty that he kept
from repeating it. At last he could keep still
no longer, yet he dared not disobey the King
and break his promise. So he went into a
vacant field and dug a deep hole in the
ground. Then, kneeling down, he breathed
into the hole these words: “King Midas has
the ears of an ass; King Midas has the ears
of an ass.”</p>

<p>Rising, he covered the hole with earth and
hastened away.</p>

<p>But what do you suppose happened?</p>

<p>The next spring the field produced a great
crop of rushes, and when the rushes had
grown quite tall a wind passed over them,
and the rushes murmured, “King Midas has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
the ears of an ass. King Midas has the ears
of an ass.”</p>

<p>And all summer long, whenever a breeze
swept over the field, the rushes murmured,
“King Midas has the ears of an ass.”</p>

<p>And when the hair-dresser heard it, he
wrung his hands in despair, and said, “Not
even the rushes of the field can keep a secret.”</p>

<h4>Hold Fast, Tom<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></h4>

<p>The sun was setting over the island of St.
Helena on a spring evening in 1673, and in
its red glow the vast black cliffs stood out
like the walls of a fortress above the great
waste of lonely sea that lay around them
as far as the eye could reach. Very quiet
and very lonesome did it appear, that tiny
islet of St. Helena, far away in the heart of
the boundless ocean.</p>

<p>But there was <i>one</i> part of the island that
was busy and noisy enough, and that was the
spot where the low white houses and single
church-spire of Jamestown, half buried in
clustering leaves, nestled in a deep gully close
to the water’s edge, walled in by two mighty
precipices nearly a thousand feet in height.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
All along the line of forts and batteries,
perched like birds’ nests among the frowning
crags that overhung the sea, there was
an unwonted stir and bustle. Cannon were
rumbling to and fro, rusty pikes and muskets
were being dragged forth and laid in readiness,
soldiers in buff jackets and big looped-up
hats were clustering along the ramparts,
while hoarse words of command, clanking
swords, the ceaseless tramp of feet, and the
clatter of gun-stocks and pike-staves made
every cranny of the surrounding cliffs echo
again. What could it all mean?</p>

<p>It meant that the stout-hearted Dutchmen
who had taken the island from England a
few months before were about to have their
courage again put to the proof. Those five
ships of war in the offing, coming down before
the wind under a full press of sail, had just
hoisted the red cross of St. George (not yet
changed into the Union Jack), and Englishman
and Dutchman alike were eager to try</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Be the better man,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">as one of their favorite songs worded it.</p>

<p>Neither side, certainly, lost any time in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
beginning. The sturdy Hollanders did not
wait even for a summons to surrender. The
foremost English ship had barely dropped
her anchor in front of the Zwart Steen Battery,
when there was a red flash from the old
gray wall, a loud bang, and then a cannon-ball
came tearing through the foretopsail, and
splashed into the water far beyond. Bang
went the Englishman’s whole broadside in
return, and the balls were heard rattling
among the rocks, or crashing into the front of
the breastwork; and now the fight began in
earnest.</p>

<p>Fire, smoke, flying shot, crashing timbers,
deafening uproar, multiplied a thousand-fold
by the echoes of the surrounding hills—it
was a hard fight, for there were Dutchmen
behind those batteries who had swept the
Channel with Van Tromp, and there were
Englishmen aboard those ships who had
fought him and his men, yardarm to yardarm,
under Robert Blake; and it would have
been hard to tell which were the braver or
the more stubborn of the two.</p>

<p>“Fire away, boys, for the honor of
Old England!” shouted Captain Richard
Munden, pacing up and down the quarter-deck<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
of the British flagship amid a hail of
shot.</p>

<p>“Stand to it, my sons, as if Father Van
Tromp were with you still!” cried the brave
old Dutch commandant, Pieter Van Gebhardt,
as he leveled a gun with his own hands
over the fast-crumbling parapet. “Fear not
for the fire and smoke; it is but the Englishman
lighting his pipe.”</p>

<p>Both sides fought stoutly, and men began
to fall fast; but it seemed as if on the whole
the Dutch were getting the best of it. The
ships, lying out upon the smooth water, made
an excellent mark, while the rock-cut batteries
could hardly be distinguished from the cliff
itself.</p>

<p>But just at that moment a very unexpected
turn of fortune changed the whole face of the
battle.</p>

<p>To explain clearly how this happened we
must go back a little way.</p>

<p>The Dutch garrison had given their whole
attention to the attack in front, feeling sure
that this was the only point from which they
could be assailed. And they reasoned well;
for everywhere else the coast was merely one
great precipice of several hundred feet, rising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
so sheer out of the sea that it seemed as if
nothing without wings could possibly scale it.</p>

<p>But they might, perhaps, have been less
confident had they seen what was going on
just then at the opposite side of the island.</p>

<p>When the English ships first advanced to
the attack, the hindmost of them, while still
hidden from the Dutch by the huge black
pyramid of Sugar-loaf Point, had lowered
several large boats filled with armed men,
which instantly shot away round the great
rocky bluff of “the Barn” as fast as eight
oars apiece could carry them.</p>

<p>Away they went, past headland after headland,
while every eye was fixed upon the
rocky shore, as if seeking something which
was not easily to be found.</p>

<p>At length, just when they rounded the bold,
craggy promontory of King and Queen point,
a dull boom reached their ears, followed instantly
by the thunder of a sustained cannonade.
At that familiar sound the sailors
clenched their teeth savagely, as they looked
up at the tremendous precipices that seemed
to shut them out from all hope of taking part
in the battle.</p>

<p>“Can’t we get up anywhere?” growled the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
captain, of the frigate, who was in the foremost
boat. “We’re disgraced forever if
they do the job without us.”</p>

<p>“With your honor’s leave,” broke in a
stalwart young topman, touching his thick
brown forelock, “I think I could get up that
rock yonder, and fasten a rope for the rest
to climb by.”</p>

<p>“What! up there?” cried the captain,
glancing doubtfully from the young sailor’s
bright, fearless face to the tremendous height
above. “Well, my lad, if you can do it, I’ll
give you fifty guineas!”</p>

<p>“It’s for the honor of the flag, not for
the money, sir!” answered the seaman,
springing from the boat to the lowest ledge
of the terrible rock.</p>

<p>Up, up, up, ever higher he clambered, with
the rising wind flinging his loose hair to and
fro, and the startled sea-birds whirling
around him with hoarse screams of mingled
fear and rage. To the watching eyes far
below, the tiny points of rock to which he
clung were quite invisible, and he seemed
to be hanging in mid-air, like a fly on the side
of a wall.</p>

<p>And now he was two-thirds of the way up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
the precipice; and now he was within a few
yards of the top; and now his hand almost
touched the highest ledge, when suddenly his
feet were seen to slide from under him, and
in a moment he was swinging in the empty
air, grasping a projecting crag with the
strength of desperation.</p>

<p>“Hold fast, Tom!” yelled his comrades,
as they saw him.</p>

<p>Tom did hold fast, and the strong hands
that had defied the full fury of an Atlantic
gale to loosen them from the slippery rigging
did him good service once more. He regained
his footing, and the indrawn breath of the
anxious gazers below sounded like a hiss in
the grim silence as they watched the final
effort that brought him safely to the top.</p>

<p>The rope was soon fixed, and the last man
had scarcely mounted when the daring band
were hurrying across the ridgy interior of
the island toward the spot whence the cannonade
still boomed upon the evening air.
And there it was at last, as they crowned
the farthest ridge, the tall masts standing
up through billowy smoke, and the batteries
marked out amid the gathering darkness by
the flashes of their own cannon. A deadly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
volley of English musketry cracked along
the cliff, and several of the Dutch were seen
to fall while dismay and confusion spread
fast among the survivors. Thus, caught between
two fires, with the British ships thundering
upon them from below, and the British
marksmen shooting them down from above,
the defenders had no chance; and at length
brave old Van Gebhardt, with a look of bitter
grief on his iron face, slowly hauled down
the Dutch flag in token of surrender.</p>

<p>“Mynheer,” said he to the English captain,
as the latter came marching into the
fort at the head of his men, “my followers
have done all that men could do; but yours
have done more.”</p>

<p>“And if we had not done more, we could
never have beaten the gallant Dutchmen,”
answered the captain, taking off his battered
cocked hat with a polite bow.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the English regained
St. Helena, over which the British flag flies
to this day. Nor has the brave fellow who
led that daring attack been forgotten, for
the crag which he scaled (and a very grim-looking
crag it is) still goes by the name of
“Hold-Fast Tom.”</p>

<h4>Nils and the Bear<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></h4>

<div class="smaller">

<p>[Nils Holgarsson, a young boy, has been traveling high
over the country in company with a wild goose. He is
blown from her back during a hard wind, and alights
among the iron mines. He is discovered by bears and
taken to their cave.]</p>

</div>

<p>Father Bear pushed Mother Bear aside.</p>

<p>“Don’t meddle with what you don’t understand!”
he roared. “Can’t you scent that
human odor about him from afar? I shall
eat him at once, or he will play us some mean
trick.”</p>

<p>He opened his jaws again; but meanwhile
Nils had had time to think, and,
quick as a flash, he dug into his knapsack
and brought forth some matches—his sole
weapon of defense—struck one on his
leather breeches, and stuck the burning
match into the bear’s open mouth.</p>

<p>Father Bear snorted when he smelled the
burning sulphur, and with that the flame
went out. The boy was ready with another
match, but, curiously enough, Father Bear
did not repeat his attack.</p>

<p>“Can you light many of those little blue
roses?” asked Father Bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>“I can light enough to put an end to the
whole forest,” replied the boy, for he thought
that in this way he might be able to scare
Father Bear.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you could also set fire to houses
and barns?” said Father Bear.</p>

<p>“Oh, that would be no trick for me!”
boasted the boy, hoping that this would make
the bear respect him.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed the bear. “You shall
render me a service. Now, I’m very glad
that I did not eat you.”</p>

<p>Father Bear carefully took the boy between
his tusks and climbed up from the pit.
As soon as he was up he speedily made for
the woods. It was evident that Father Bear
was created to squeeze through dense forests.
The heavy body pushed through the brushwood
as a boat does through the water.</p>

<p>Father Bear ran along till he came to a
hill at the skirt of the forest, where he could
see the big noise-shop. Here he lay down
and placed the boy in front of him, holding
him securely between his forepaws.</p>

<p>“Now look down at that big noise-shop!”
he commanded.</p>

<p>The great iron works, with many tall buildings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
stood at the edge of a waterfall. High
chimneys sent forth dark clouds of smoke,
blasting furnaces were in full blaze, and light
shone from all the windows and apertures.
Within, hammers and rolling mills were going
with such force that the air rang with
their clatter and boom. Just beyond the
workshops were long rows of workingmen’s
homes, pretty villas, schoolhouses, assembly
halls, and shops. But there all was quiet and
apparently everybody was asleep. The boy
did not glance in that direction, but gazed
intently at the iron works. The earth
around them was black; the sky above them
was like a great fiery dome; the rapids,
white with foam, rushed by; while the buildings
themselves were sending out light and
smoke, fire and sparks. It was the grandest
sight the boy had ever seen.</p>

<p>“Surely you don’t mean to say you can
set fire to a place like that?” remarked the
bear doubtingly.</p>

<p>The boy, wedged between the beast’s paws,
was thinking the only thing that might save
him would be that the bear should have a high
opinion of his capability and power.</p>

<p>“It’s all the same to me,” he answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
with a superior air. “Big or little, I can
burn it down.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell you something,” said Father
Bear. “My forefathers lived in this region
from the time that the forests first sprang
up. From them I inherited hunting grounds
and pastures, lairs and retreats, and have
lived here in peace all my life. In the beginning
I wasn’t troubled much by the human
kind. They dug in the mountains and picked
up a little ore down here by the rapids; they
had a forge and a furnace, but the hammers
sounded only a few hours during the day,
and the furnace was not fired more than two
moons at a stretch. It wasn’t so bad
but that I could stand it; but these last
years, since they have built this noise shop,
which keeps up the same racket both day and
night, life here has become intolerable.
There are so many people that I never feel
safe from them. I thought that I should
have to move away, but I have discovered
something better!”</p>

<p>The boy wondered what Father Bear had
hit upon, but no opportunity was afforded
him to ask, as the bear took him between his
forepaws and held him up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>“Try to look into the house!” he commanded.
A strong current of air was forced
into a big cylinder which was suspended
from the ceiling and filled with molten iron.
As this current rushed into the mess of iron
with an awful roar, showers of sparks of all
colours spurted up in bunches, in sprays, in
long clusters! They struck against the wall
and came splashing down over the whole big
room. Father Bear let the boy watch the
gorgeous spectacle until the blowing was
over and the flowing and sparkling red steel
had been poured into ingot moulds.</p>

<p>The boy was completely charmed by the
marvellous display and almost forgot that
he was imprisoned between a bear’s two
paws.</p>

<p>“I call that real man’s work!” the boy
remarked to himself.</p>

<p>The bear then let the boy have a peep
at the furnace and the forge, and he became
more and more astonished as he saw how the
blacksmiths handled iron and fire.</p>

<p>“Those men have no fear of heat and
flames,” he thought. The workmen were
sooty and grimy. He fancied they were some
sort of firefolk—that was why they could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
bend and mould the iron as they wished. He
could not believe that they were just ordinary
men, since they had such power!</p>

<p>“They keep this up day after day, night
after night,” said Father Bear, as he
dropped wearily down on the ground. “You
can understand that one gets rather tired of
that kind of thing. I’m mighty glad that
at last I can put an end to it!”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said the boy. “How will you
go about it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought that you were going to set
fire to the buildings!” said Father Bear.
“That would put an end to all this work,
and I could remain in my old home.”</p>

<p>The boy was all of a shiver.</p>

<p>So, it was for this that Father Bear had
brought him here!</p>

<p>“If you will set fire to the noise-works
I’ll promise to spare your life,” said Father
Bear. “But if you don’t do it, I’ll make
short work of you! Will you or won’t you?”</p>

<p>The boy knew that he ought to answer
promptly that he would not, but he also knew
that then the bear’s paws would squeeze him
to death; therefore he replied:</p>

<p>“I shall have to think it over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>“Very well, do so,” assented Father
Bear. “Let me say to you that iron is the
thing that has given men the advantage over
us bears, which is another reason for my
wishing to put an end to the work here.”</p>

<p>The boy thought he would use the delay
to figure out a way of escape, but instead he
began to think of the great help that iron
had been to mankind. They needed iron for
everything. There was iron in the plow that
broke up the field; in the axe that felled the
tree for building houses; in the scythe that
mowed the grain; and in the knife, which
would be turned to all sorts of uses. There
was iron in the horse’s bit, in the lock on the
door, in the nails that held furniture together.
The rifle that drove away wild beasts
was made of iron; iron covered the men-of-war;
the locomotives steamed through the
country on iron rails; the needle that had
stitched his coat was of iron; the shears that
clipped the sheep and the kettle that cooked
the food. Father Bear was perfectly right
in saying that it was the iron that had given
men their mastery over the bears.</p>

<p>“Now will you or won’t you?” Father
Bear repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>The boy was startled from his musing.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t be so impatient,” he said.
“This is a serious matter for me, and I’ve
got to have time to consider.”</p>

<p>“I can wait a little longer,” said Father
Bear. “But after that you’ll get no more
grace.”</p>

<p>The boy swept his hand across his forehead.
No plan of escape had as yet come to
his mind, but this much he knew—he did
not wish to do any harm to the iron, which
was so useful to rich and poor alike, and
which gave bread to so many people in this
land.</p>

<p>“Come, come!” growled the bear. “Will
you or won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I won’t!” said the boy.</p>

<p>Father Bear squeezed him a little harder,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>“You’ll not get me to destroy the iron works!”
defied the boy. “The iron is so
great a blessing that it will never do to
harm it.”</p>

<p>“Then, of course, you don’t expect to be
allowed to live very long?” said the bear.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t expect it,” returned the boy,
looking the bear straight in the eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>Father Bear gripped him a little harder.</p>

<p>But just then the boy heard something
click very close to them, and saw the muzzle
of a rifle two paces away.</p>

<p>“Father Bear! Don’t you hear the clicking
of a trigger?” cried the boy. “Run,
or you’ll be shot!”</p>

<p>Father Bear grew terribly hurried. He
thought he heard hounds and hunters pursuing
him.</p>

<p>But the boy stood in the forest, free and
unharmed, and could hardly understand how
it was possible.</p>

<h4>Jericho Bob<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></h4>

<p>Jericho Bob, when he was four years old,
hoped that one day he might be allowed to
eat just as much turkey as he possibly could.
He was eight now, but that hope had not been
realized.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jericho Bob, his mother, kept hens
for a living, and she expected that they would
lay enough eggs in the course of time to help
her son to an independent career as a boot-black.</p>

<p>They lived in a tumbledown house in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
waste of land near the steam cars, and besides
her hens, Mrs. Bob owned a goat.</p>

<p>Our story has, however, nothing to do with
the goat except to say he was there, and
that he was on nibbling terms, not only with
Jericho Bob, but with Bob’s bosom friend,
Julius Caesar Fish, and it was surprising
how many old hat-brims and other tidbits
of clothing he could swallow during a day.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Bob truly said, it was no earthly
use to get something new for Jericho, even
if she could afford it; for the goat browsed
all over him, and had been known to carry
away even a leg of his trousers.</p>

<p>Jericho Bob was eight years old, and the
friend of his bosom, Julius Caesar Fish, was
nine. They both, were of a lovely black; a
tallow-dip couldn’t take the kink out of their
hair, and the hardest whipping did not disturb
the even cheerfulness of their spirits.
They were so much alike that if it hadn’t
been for Jericho’s bow-legs and his turn-up
nose, you really could not have told them
apart.</p>

<p>A kindred taste for turkey also united
them.</p>

<p>In honor of Thanksgiving Day, Mrs. Bob<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
always sacrificed a hen which would, but for
such blessed release, have died of old age.
One drumstick was given to Jericho, whose
interior remained an unsatisfied void.</p>

<p>Jericho Bob had heard of turkey as a fowl
larger, sweeter, and more tender than hen;
and about Thanksgiving time he would
linger around the provision stores and gaze
with open mouth at the noble array of turkeys
hanging, head downward, over bushels
of cranberries, as if even at that uncooked
stage, they were destined for one another.
And turkey was his dream.</p>

<p>It was springtime, and the hens were being
a credit to themselves. Mrs. Bob was
laid up with rheumatism.</p>

<p>“Jericho Bob!” she said to her son, shaking
her red and yellow turban at him, “Jericho
Bob, you go down an’ fetch de eggs today.
Ef I find yer don’t bring me twenty-three,
I’ll—well, never mind what I’ll do,
but yer won’t like it.”</p>

<p>Now, Jericho Bob meant to be honest, but
the fact was he found twenty-four eggs, and
the twenty-fourth was so big, so remarkably
big!</p>

<p>Twenty-three eggs he brought to Mrs. Bob,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
but the twenty-fourth he sinfully left in
charge of the discreet hen.</p>

<p>On his return he met Julius Caesar Fish,
with his hands in his pockets and his head
extinguished by his grandfather’s fur cap.</p>

<p>Together they went toward the hen-coop
and Julius Caesar Fish spoke, or rather
lisped (he had lost some of his front teeth):</p>

<p>“Jericho Bobth, tha’th a turkey’th egg.”</p>

<p>“Yer don’t say so?”</p>

<p>“I think i’th a-goin’ ter hatch.” No
sooner said than they heard a pick and a
peck in the shell.</p>

<p>“Pick!” a tiny beak broke through the
shell. “Peck!” more beak. “Crack!” a
funny little head, a long, bare neck, and then
“Pick! Peck! Crack!” before them stood
the funniest, fluffiest brown ball resting on
two weak little legs.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” shouted the woolly heads.</p>

<p>“Peep!” said turkeykin.</p>

<p>“It’s mine!” Jericho shouted excitedly.</p>

<p>“Ith Marm Pitkin’th turkey’th; she laid
it there.”</p>

<p>“It’s mine, and I’m going to keep it, and
next Thanksgiving I’m going ter eat him.”</p>

<p>“Think yer ma’ll let you feed him up for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
thath?” Julius Caesar asked, grinning triumphantly.</p>

<p>Jericho Bob’s next Thanksgiving dinner
seemed destined to be a dream. His face
fell.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell yer whath I’ll do,” his friend
said, benevolently; “I’ll keep ’m for you,
and Thanksgivin’ we’ll go halvth.”</p>

<p>Jericho resigned himself to the inevitable,
and the infant turkey was borne home by
his friend.</p>

<p>Fish, Jr., lived next door, and the only
difference in the premises was a freight-car
permanently switched off before the broken-down
fence of the Fish yard; and in this car
turkeykin took up his abode.</p>

<p>I will not tell you how he grew and more
than realized the hopes of his foster-fathers,
nor with what impatience and anticipation
they saw spring, summer, and autumn pass,
while they watched their Thanksgiving dinner
stalk proudly up the bare yard, and even
hop across the railroad tracks.</p>

<p>But, alas! the possession of the turkey
brought with it strife and discord.</p>

<p>Quarrels arose between the friends as to
the prospective disposal of his remains. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
grieve to say that the question of who was
to cook him led to blows.</p>

<p>It was the day before Thanksgiving. There
was a coldness between the friends which
was not dispelled by the bringing of a pint
of cranberries to the common store by Jericho,
and the contributing thereto of a couple
of cold boiled sweet potatoes by Julius Caesar
Fish.</p>

<p>The friends sat on an ancient wash-tub
in the back yard, and there was a momentary
truce between them. Before them stood the
freight-car, and along the track beyond an
occasional train tore down the road, which
so far excited their mutual sympathy that
they rose and shouted as one man.</p>

<p>At the open door of the freight-car stood
the unsuspecting turkey, and looked meditatively
out on the landscape and at the two
figures on the wash-tub.</p>

<p>One had bow-legs, a turn-up nose, and a
huge straw hat. The other wore a fur cap
and a gentleman’s swallow-tail coat, with the
tails caught up because they were too long.</p>

<p>The turkey hopped out of the car and
gazed confidingly at his protectors. In point
of size he was altogether their superior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>“I think,” said Jericho Bob, “we’d better
ketch ’im; tomorrow’s Thanksgiving.
Yum!”</p>

<p>And he looked with great joy at the innocent,
the unsuspecting fowl.</p>

<p>“Butcher Tham’th goin’ to kill ’im for
uth,” Julius Caesar hastened to say, “an’
I kin cook ’im.”</p>

<p>“No, you ain’t. I’m going to cook ’im,”
Jericho Bob cried, resentfully. “He’s
mine.”</p>

<p>“He ain’th; he’th mine.”</p>

<p>“He was my egg,” and Jericho Bob
danced defiance at his friend.</p>

<p>The turkey looked on with some surprise,
and he became alarmed when he saw his foster-fathers
clasped in an embrace more of
anger than of love.</p>

<p>“I’ll eat ’im all alone!” Jericho Bob
cried.</p>

<p>“No, yes sha’n’t!” the other shouted.</p>

<p>The turkey shrieked in terror, and fled in
a circle about the yard.</p>

<p>“Now, look yere,” said Julius Caesar,
who had conquered. “We’re goin’ to be
squar’. He wath your egg, but who brought
’im up? Me! Who’th got a friend to kill<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
’im? Me! Who’th got a fire to cook ’im?
Me! Now you git up and we’ll kitch ’im.
Ef you thay another word about your egg
I’ll jeth eat ’im up all mythelf.”</p>

<p>Jericho Bob was conquered. With mutual
understanding they approached the turkey.</p>

<p>“Come yere; come yere,” Julius Caesar
said, coaxingly.</p>

<p>For a moment the bird gazed at both, uncertain
what to do.</p>

<p>“Come yere,” Julius Caesar repeated,
and made a dive for him. The turkey spread
his tail. Oh, didn’t he run!</p>

<p>“Now, I’ve got her!” the wicked Jericho
Bob cried, and thought he had captured the
fowl; when, with a shriek from Jericho Bob,
as the turkey knocked him over, the Thanksgiving
dinner spread his wings, rose in the
air, and alighted on the roof of the freight-car.</p>

<p>The turkey looked down over the edge of
the car at his enemies, and they gazed up at
him. Both parties surveyed the situation.</p>

<p>“We’ve got him,” Julius Caesar cried at
last, exultantly. “You git on the roof, and
ef you don’t kitch ’im up thar, I’ll kitch
’im down yere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>With the help of the wash-tub, an old
chair, Julius Caesar’s back, and much scrambling,
Jericho Bob was boosted on top of the
car. The turkey was stalking solemnly up
and down the roof with tail and wings half
spread.</p>

<p>“I’ve got yer now,” Jericho Bob said,
creeping softly after him. “I’ve got yer
now, sure,” he was just repeating, when,
with a deafening roar the express-train for
New York came tearing down the road.</p>

<p>For what possible reason it slowed up on
approaching the freight-car nobody ever
knew; but the fact remains that it did, just
as Jericho Bob laid his wicked black, paw on
the turkey’s tail.</p>

<p>The turkey shrieked, spread his wings,
shook the small black boy’s grasp from his
tail, and with a mighty swoop alighted on the
roof of the very last car as it passed; and
in a moment more Jericho Bob’s Thanksgiving
dinner had vanished, like a beautiful
dream, down the road!</p>

<h4>Jerusalem Artie’s Christmas Dinner<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></h4>

<p>Jerusalem Artie sat on the door-step of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
his mammy’s cabin, buried in thought. It
was a very unusual condition for Jerusalem
Artie, but then, the occasion was an unusual
one. The next day would be Christmas.</p>

<p>Presently he looked up. “Mammy,” he
questioned, “what’s we-all a-gwine hab fo’
Chris-mus dinnah?”</p>

<p>“Lan’ sakes, chile,” his mammy answered,
“how-all’s I a-gwine know dat? Yo’ pappy
ain’t got nuthin’ yit, an’ I ain’t a-reckonin’
he will git nuthin’.”</p>

<p>Jerusalem Artie looked down, and was once
more lost in thought.</p>

<p>He made a comical little figure there on
the door-step, but to this fact both he and
his mammy were blissfully oblivious. On his
head he wore an old straw hat which his
pappy had discarded for a fur cap at the
approach of winter weather. In the spring
the exchange would be made again, and
Jerusalem Artie would wear the fur. But
this did not trouble the boy. When it grew
too hot, he left off any sort of head covering;
and when it grew too cold, he wrapped one
of mammy’s gay bandanas about his woolly
head, and set the battered straw on top of
that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>His shirt, and his one-sided suspenders,
and even the trousers that he wore, had also
belonged to his pappy. As Jerusalem Artie
was only eight years old, the trousers were
a trifle long. He had once suggested cutting
them off, but his mammy had objected.</p>

<p>“Co’se yo’ cain’t, chile! Yo’ pappy might
hab to weah dem pants some mo’ hisself yit,
an’ how-all’d he look den?”</p>

<p>The question was unanswerable.</p>

<p>“An’ what-all’d <i>I</i> weah den?” he had
queried, dismayed at the possibility.</p>

<p>“How-all yo’ s’pose I’s a-gwine know
dat?” his mammy had responded. “Maybe
yo’ skin.”</p>

<p>So Jerusalem Artie had rolled, and rolled,
and rolled the bottom of the trouser legs till
his little black toes emerged from the
openings.</p>

<p>But now, as he sat on the door-step, his
mind was not upon his clothes, not even upon
the offending trousers. It was upon the
Christmas dinner for which he was longing,
but which did not exist.</p>

<p>“All neighbo’ folks a-gwine hab Chris’mus
dinnahs,” he was saying to himself. “Boys
done tol’ me so. An’ we’s gwine hab Chris’mus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
dinnah, too,” he added, straightening up
suddenly.</p>

<p>He got up from the door-step and started
slowly toward the bit of tangled underbrush
that grew back of the cabin. He did not know,
yet, where the Christmas dinner was coming
from. He had gotten no further than the
resolve that there should be one.</p>

<p>“Folks hab turkey, er goose,” he was saying
to himself, “er chickun, er—rabbit pie,”
he ended with a sudden whoop, and made a
dash toward the tangled brush, for, at that
very moment, a rabbit’s white flag of a tail
had flashed before his eyes.</p>

<p>“Hi, yo’ Molly Cottontail, I git yo’ fo’ a
pie!” yelled Jerusalem Artie, and the chase
was on.</p>

<p>Into the brush dashed Molly, and after her
came Jerusalem Artie; and, as he ran, one
leg of his trousers began to unroll. But there
was no time to stop.</p>

<p>Molly Cottontail had the advantage, but
Jerusalem Artie’s eyes were sharp, and
Molly’s white flag led him on. Molly slid
beneath the tangled brush, and Jerusalem
Artie made desperate leaps above it, each
leap marked by a flying trouser leg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly Molly doubled on her tracks, for
her pursuer was close at hand. Jerusalem
Artie attempted to do the same, but his free
foot became entangled with the elongated leg,
and down went Jerusalem Artie—squarely
on top of Molly Cottontail.</p>

<p>It pretty well knocked the breath out of
both of them, but Jerusalem Artie recovered
first, naturally, for he was on top.</p>

<p>“Chris’mus pie! Chris’mus pie!” he
squealed, as he wriggled one hand cautiously
beneath him and got a good firm hold of
Molly’s long ears. Then carefully he got
upon his feet.</p>

<p>The rabbit hung limp from his hand.</p>

<p>“Knocked yo’ breaf’ clean out fo’ suah!” he
exclaimed, deliberately surveying his prize.</p>

<p>Then slowly he made his way to the road,
for the chase had taken him some distance
from the cabin, and the dragging trouser leg
made walking difficult.</p>

<p>Reaching the roadside, he held aloft the
still limp rabbit surveying it with a grin of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Reckon she’s done fo’ as suah as I’s a
niggah chile,” he soliloquized; and laying his
Christmas dinner on the grass beside him, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
proceeded to roll up the entangling trouser
leg.</p>

<p>While he was in the midst of this occupation,
there was a startling “honk, honk,”
close at hand and a big red motor car flashed
into sight.</p>

<p>The sudden noise startled Jerusalem Artie.
It also startled Molly Cottontail. Her limp,
and apparently lifeless, body gathered itself,
leaped, and cleared the roadway, barely
escaping the wheels of the big red motor car
as it flashed by.</p>

<p>Jerusalem Artie rose to his feet, the trouser
leg half rolled, and shrieked: “M’
Chris’mus dinnah! M’ Chris’mus dinnah!”
for Molly Cottontail had disappeared.</p>

<p>As he stood looking helplessly after the
offending cause of his loss, a man in the back
seat turned, laughed, and, leaning over the
side of the car, threw something bright and
shining back into the road.</p>

<p>Jerusalem Artie pounced upon the spot,
dug with his disentangled toes in the dust, and
brought to view a silver half-dollar.</p>

<p>“Chris’mus dinnah yit,” he exclaimed,
“as suah as I’se a niggah chile!”</p>

<p>Then, with the half-dollar held hard between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
his teeth, he finished rolling up the
leg of his trousers.</p>

<p>“Mammy,” he cried, a moment later, as,
dusty and breathless, he reappeared in the
cabin doorway, “see what-all I foun’ in de
road.”</p>

<p>And Mammy’s look of dark suspicion faded
as Jerusalem Artie recounted his brief and
tragic adventure with Molly Cottontail.</p>

<p>“Yo-all’s a honey chile,” said Mammy,
when he had concluded; “an we-all’s
a-gwine right now an’ git a plumb fat
chickun.”</p>

<p>The next day, as Mammy cleared away the
remains of the Christmas dinner, she said:
“Now, chile, yo’ c’n tote dese yere chickun
bones out on de do’-step an’ gnaw ’em clean.
An’, Jerus’lem Artie, yo’ pappy say yo’ c’n
cut off de laigs o’ dem pants, an’ hab ’em fo’
yo’self.”</p>

<h4>Robin’s Christmas<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></h4>

<p>When I was a little girl I used to look for
Robin Redbreast perched in the holly on my
Christmas cards, and nearly always he was
there, fluttering about in the green, or singing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
a merry greeting from among the red
berries. Nowadays I do not see him so often,
but I have heard the story of how he came to
be there. Listen, and you shall hear it, too.</p>

<p>First, you must know that the English
Robin Redbreast (which is the one in my
story) does not go South in the fall as our
robin does. That is why the little English
children sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The North wind doth blow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And we shall have snow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And what will the robin do then, poor thing?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He’ll stay in the barn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And keep himself warm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And tuck his head under his wing, poor thing.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Generally Robin gets through the winter
very well, but sometimes he has a pretty hard
time, and that is why this story came to be
told.</p>

<p>One year, about Christmas time, there
came a long spell of cold, stormy weather.
It would snow, and all the children would
shout for joy; then it would rain, and they
would almost cry from disappointment;
then again it would freeze, and they would
run and slide and skate on the ice, only to
be driven in by more snow and wind. So<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
Christmas eve found them all snug in their
houses, making the rooms gay with holly and
evergreen, and talking about Santa Claus
and their Christmas stockings.</p>

<p>But outdoors in the cold a poor little Robin
Redbreast was far from being snug and comfortable.
It seemed to him that he hadn’t
had anything to eat for a month. Every
grain of corn in the barnyard was under the
snow, no one threw out any crumbs, and the
seed pods and berries that were food in the
coldest weather were so thickly coated with
ice that it was like pecking glass beads to
try to eat one. The North wind seemed to
be everywhere. It drove him out of each corner
in which he tried to nestle, and Farmer
Gray’s barn door was closed while he was
busy in the hedge trying to get a mouthful
of seeds. When it came night, poor Robin
felt so chilled and hungry and miserable that
he simply couldn’t “tuck his head under his
wing,” much less “keep himself warm.”</p>

<p>Once, when the lamps were lighted, he
fluttered up to a window and tried to get
behind the blind, but he could not squeeze
in. Then he pecked at the glass, for he was
a friendly birdie, and had more than once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
been fed from a window, but no one heard
his little tap, tap, and away he flew, trying
once more to find shelter from the driving
storm.</p>

<p>Now, there was a church near by. People
had been going in and out all day, making
it beautiful with Christmas greens, and preparing
the children’s Christmas tree. Robin
finally perched himself in the ivy at one window,
though the North wind threatened to
blow him off any moment. There were lights
within, and he could hear the happy children
gathered round the Christmas tree. After
awhile every one went away, and the lights
were turned out.</p>

<p>A half hour later the faithful sexton
came back through the storm to take one
more look at his fires, and make sure that
all was safe for the night. Robin, just settling
himself for a long, cold night, could
see his lantern swinging as he pushed his
way through the snowdrifts. When he
opened the great church door, the wind and
snow blew in—and something else, too—a
cold, hungry little robin. But the sexton
never knew. He banked his fires a little
more and went home, leaving Robin alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<p>Oh, how warm and quiet and comfortable
it was! Robin tucked his head under his
wing and was soon asleep on an oaken rafter.
When he awoke in the morning, his first
thought was that he was in the forest. How
big and green and beautiful! Evergreen and
holly were everywhere. Great festoons were
looped from chancel to window. A great
mass of holly hid the choir rail. Little
Christmas trees were banked against the
walls. Wreaths hung from the arches, and
the red and golden lights from the windows
bathed all in sunshine. Robin could hardly
believe his eyes.</p>

<p>“Chirp! Chirp!” he cried, and flew from
rafter to rafter, and from there to the organ
loft. What a wonderful place to awaken in!
Why had he never found it before? And
what were those little red berries? Were
they really good to eat?</p>

<p>“Chirp! Chirp! I think I’ll try one!”
said he.</p>

<p>He hadn’t had a good meal for two days
and a half, and if the ladies could have seen
him eating their lovely decorations, I am
afraid they would have been shocked. How
good the holly berries tasted! And there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
was such an abundance! No hunting and
picking good from bad; no fuss of any kind.
Hungry Robin flew from festoon to wreath
and enjoyed the best breakfast he had known
that winter. In fact, he ate till he was tired,
and then he had another little nap on the
rafter.</p>

<p>While he was sleeping the church bell
rang, and the children began to flock in again.
They had come to sing their carols at early
morning service, and soon the church was
filled with happy faces. Then the organ
played and they began to sing. Robin woke
up and watched everything quietly from his
perch. He felt warm and happy, and he liked
the music; in fact, he began to feel like singing,
too. In the middle of the second verse
he broke in. High and clear and sweet he
sang, and the children looked up amazed.
Suddenly the minister held up his hand.
Wonderingly the organist and the children
ceased. Robin was singing a solo, now.
Perched high on the rafter, he threw his little
head back and sang and sang, while the delighted
children listened. When had they
ever heard Robin Redbreast sing in church?
How did he get in? What a wonderful song!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>When Robin was through he flew to the top
of the organ and looked down on them with
bright eyes, as if to say: “That is all I can
do to thank you for my breakfast and shelter!”</p>

<p>“Children,” said the minister, “this little
bird must have flown in here last night from
the storm. He sings because he is grateful to
the Heavenly Father who cares for all, and
knows when even a sparrow falleth. Let us
lift our hearts and voices, and thank him in
our carols for this happy Christmas. Let our
voices be as sweet as Robin Redbreast’s—our
little brother who is welcome to all the
comfort our church can give him!”</p>

<p>The children sang their carols as they
never sang them before, and they never forgot
the Christmas day when they found Robin
in church. That was years ago, but that is
why, for a long time, Robin Redbreast was on
the Christmas cards. Did you ever see him
there?</p>

<h4>A Tale of the Christ Child<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></h4>

<p>It was Christmas eve. The soft snow fell
in big flakes like white blossoms from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
trees of June. It covered the house roofs
and glorified the trees. It hung jewels above
the windows of the poor, and softened the
lowliest hut to the white beauty of a palace.</p>

<p>And through the beautiful white pathway
of the snow a herald rode, and cried that to-night
the dear Christ Child would walk
through the streets, and even as the falling
snow made all barren and ugly things lovely,
so would the Christ Child’s coming glorify
the souls of them that met him aright, and
they would be forever blest who should gain
speech with him.</p>

<p>No wonder that a million candles lighted
the streets. No wonder that great and proud,
rich and poor, the sick, the old, and the lame
thronged the white beauty of the streets
and wandered up and down, wondering and
waiting.</p>

<p>The King came forth in royal robes with
a throng of courtiers at his back. He bore
himself proudly, and proudly he waited.</p>

<p>The priest was there, bearing the blessed
cross, and lifting prayerful eyes to the white
sky.</p>

<p>The great singer came, singing his loveliest
songs in tones so sweet that all who heard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
him wondered, and said, “Surely he will have
speech with the Christ Child.”</p>

<p>The poet came with his book, and soldiers
with gleaming swords, boasting of battles
they had won, and all looked with eager eyes
up and down the streets, each longing to be
the first to see the Christ Child in all his
beauty.</p>

<p>So, in their eagerness they pressed now
this way and now that, heeding nothing but
their one desire. The shivering beggar was
jostled, the lame man was trampled under
foot, and lay moaning in a doorway, and children
were thrust aside from their eager gazing,
and fell, weeping and disappointed, or
fled from the stern presence of some blustering
soldier, to hide in alleyways, praying that
the little Christ Child would find them there,
waiting to worship him.</p>

<p>Among the children was one braver than
the others—little Karl. He had gone out
with a glad heart, saying to his mother, “I
will not come back, though I walk the streets
all night, until I will see the Christ Child
and gain a blessing for you and for me.”
But his mother kissed him fondly, saying,
“Go my son, but do not grieve if you do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
see the Christ Child, for there is blessing
even in seeking him.”</p>

<p>So little Karl, seeing so many crushed and
crowded back, though fearing that the Christ
Child should pass while he spent the time,
lifted the lame man to a place of safety,
apart from the crowd, followed the shivering
beggar and lent him his cloak, and comforted
the weeping children.</p>

<p>And meanwhile the crowd pushed and
jostled and threatened, and no one gave
heed to a ragged boy who pressed slowly
through the throng, going from street to
street, and saying now and again, “I hunger.
Will one give me a crust of bread?”</p>

<p>No one gave heed, save that the King drew
back his royal robes and bade his courtiers
clear his pathway of beggars; the great
singer asked angrily who was this who dared
to interrupt him in his singing, and turned
his back upon the child to begin his song
anew; the poet saw him not, because his eyes
were not lifted from the book, while some,
impatient at the interrupted melody, or taking
counsel from the king’s frown, jostled him in
rude malice.</p>

<p>True, the priest turned on him a kindly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
glance and would have spoken, but that a
sudden movement in the crowd gave hope of
the Christ Child’s coming, and he forgot all
else to press after the others.</p>

<p>But little Karl, now shivering with cold,
had pity, and crept to the stranger boy’s
side, and broke his one piece of bread with
him and offered him a place in his sheltered
doorway.</p>

<p>“It is cold,” Karl said, “and I have lent
my cloak, or we could share it with each other,
and the bread is old, but it is all I have, and
indeed one feels hunger and cold but lightly
who watches for the Christ Child and hopes
for his blessing.”</p>

<p>When, lo! as the ragged boy broke the
bread and ate with Karl, his face became
glorified, and a light like soft moonlight
played about his fair temples, and the eyes
that looked into the very soul of Karl, as he
rose in glad amaze, were clear and wonderful
as the winter stars, and yet gentle as the
eyes of a pet lamb.</p>

<p>And suddenly, as he gazed, Karl fell, worshiping,
for he knew that he had had speech
with the Christ Child.</p>

<p>Then, while the crowd still surged and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
quarreled and waited, watching, the Christ
Child walked through the soft falling snows,
where little Karl led the way. And they
sought out the beggar, and the lame man,
and the little children, and the great who
were also good, and all whose smiles were
kindly and whose hearts were like those of
little children.</p>

<h4>Story of the Ark<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></h4>

<p>Now God saw that the wickedness of man
was great in the earth, and it repented God
that he had made man. But Noah was a
just man and perfect in his generation, and
Noah walked with God.</p>

<p>And God said unto Noah, The end of all
flesh is come before me; for the earth is
filled with violence through them, and, behold,
I will destroy them with the earth.</p>

<p>Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms
shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch
it within and without with pitch. A window
shalt thou make to the ark; and the door of
the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof;
with lower, second, and third stories shalt
thou make it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>And behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of
waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh;
and everything that is in the earth shall die.
But with thee will I establish my covenant;
and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and
thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives
with thee.</p>

<p>And of every living thing, two of every
sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep
them alive with thee; they shall be male and
female. Of fowls after their kind, and of
cattle, and of every creeping thing of the
earth, two of every sort shall come unto thee,
to keep them alive.</p>

<p>And take thou unto thee of all food that is
eaten; and it shall be for food for thee, and
for them.</p>

<p>Thus did Noah, according to all that God
commanded him, so did he.</p>

<h4>The Flood<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></h4>

<p>And the Lord said unto Noah, Come thou
and all thy house into the ark; for thee have
I seen righteous before me in this generation.</p>

<p>And Noah went in, and his sons, and his
wife, and his sons’ wives with him, into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
ark, because of the waters of the flood. Of
clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean,
and of fowls, and of everything that creepeth
upon the earth, there went in two and two
unto Noah into the ark, the male and the
female, as God had commanded Noah. And
the Lord shut him in.</p>

<p>And it came to pass after seven days, that
the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in
the second month, the seventeenth day of the
month, the same day were all the fountains
of the great deep broken up, and the windows
of heaven were opened.</p>

<p>And the rain was upon the earth forty days
and forty nights. And the waters increased,
and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above
the earth, and all flesh died that moved upon
the earth. And every living substance was
destroyed which was upon the face of the
ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping
things, and the fowl of the heaven; and
Noah only remained alive, and they that were
with him in the ark, and the ark went upon
the face of the waters.</p>

<p>And the waters prevailed upon the earth
an hundred and fifty days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<h4>The Olive Leaf<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></h4>

<p>And God remembered Noah, and every living
thing, and the cattle that was with him
in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over
the earth, and the waters asswaged. The
fountains also of the deep and the windows
of heaven were stopped, and the rain from
heaven was restrained; and the waters returned
from off the earth continually, and
after the end of the hundred and fifty days
the waters were abated.</p>

<p>And the ark rested in the seventh month,
on the seventeenth day of the month, upon
the mountains of Ararat. And the waters
decreased continually until the tops of the
mountains were seen.</p>

<p>And it came to pass at the end of forty
days, that Noah opened the window of the
ark which he had made: and he sent forth
a raven, which went forth to and fro, until
the waters were dried up from the earth.</p>

<p>Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see
if the waters were abated from off the
face of the ground; but the dove found no
rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned
unto him into the ark, for the waters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
were on the face of the whole earth; then
he put forth his hand, and took her, and
pulled her in unto him into the ark.</p>

<p>And he stayed yet other seven days; and
again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
and the dove came in to him in the evening;
and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt
off: so Noah knew that the waters were
abated from off the earth.</p>

<p>And he stayed yet other seven days; and
he sent forth the dove; which returned not
again unto him any more. And Noah removed
the covering of the ark, and looked,
and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.</p>

<p>And God spake unto Noah, saying, Go forth
of the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife,
and thy sons’ wives with thee. Bring forth
with thee every living thing of all flesh, both
of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping
thing that creepeth upon the earth, that
they may be fruitful and multiply upon the
earth.</p>

<p>And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his
wife, and his sons’ wives with him: every
beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl,
went forth out of the ark.</p>

<p>And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span></p>

<h4>The Rainbow of Promise<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></h4>

<p>And the Lord said in his heart, I will not
again curse the ground any more for man’s
sake; for the imagination of man’s heart is
evil from his youth; neither will I again
smite any more every thing living, as I have
done.</p>

<p>While the earth remaineth, seed time and
harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and
winter, and day and night shall not cease.</p>

<p>And God blessed Noah and his sons. And
God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with
him, saying, And I, behold, I establish my
covenant with you, and with your seed after
you; and with every living creature that is
with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of
every beast of the earth with you; from all
that go out of the ark, to every beast of the
earth. I will establish my covenant with you;
neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by
the waters of a flood; neither shall there any
more be a flood to destroy the earth.</p>

<p>And God said, This is the token of the covenant
which I make between me and you and
every living creature that is with you, for
perpetual generations: I do set my bow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of
covenant between me and the earth.</p>

<p>And it shall come to pass, when I bring
a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be
seen in the cloud: and I will remember my
covenant, which is between me and you and
every living creature of all flesh; and the
waters shall no more become a flood to destroy
all flesh.</p>

<p>And Noah lived after the flood three hundred
and fifty years. And all the days of
Noah were nine hundred and fifty years.</p>

<h4>The Story of David<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></h4>

<p>More than two thousand years ago, there
was a great battle in the land of Palestine.
At that time, Saul was king of Israel, and
the battle was fought between the Israelites
and the Philistines, their enemies. Now, the
Israelites worshiped God or Jehovah, while
the Philistines worshiped images of wood
and stone.</p>

<p>And the Philistines stood on the mountain
on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain
on the other side; and the ravine was
between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<p>And as the armies were drawn up for
battle, there stepped out from the ranks of
the Philistines a champion named Goliath.
He was a giant in stature, and he was clothed
in a corselet of scales, with a helmet of
bronze upon his head. His spear was like a
weaver’s beam—and a shield-bearer went
before him.</p>

<p>And Goliath stood and cried to the people
of Israel, “I have come forth to defy the
army of Israel. Choose ye a man who shall
come and fight with me. If he slays me, then
will the Philistines be your servants, but if
I slay him, then shall ye be the servants of
the Philistines.”</p>

<p>Then were the Israelites dismayed, and no
man dared go forth to fight with Goliath.</p>

<p>Every night and every morning for forty
days, Goliath came forth and challenged the
army of Israel, and no man dared go forth to
fight him.</p>

<p>At this same time, away off among the
hills of Bethlehem, there was a young man
named David, who was tending his father’s
sheep. He was a shepherd lad, but ruddy,
and of a beautiful appearance. His father’s
name was Jesse. Now, Jesse’s three older<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
sons were in the army of Saul, but David, the
youngest, cared for the sheep. He loved the
country about Bethlehem, and he had many
beautiful thoughts while watching over the
sheep that he loved.</p>

<p>But one day his father called him away
from the sheep pastures, and sent him to see
his brothers, and to bring back a message
from them, for he was anxious about their
welfare. And he gave him parched corn and
ten loaves as a gift for them.</p>

<p>So David journeyed to where his brothers
were, and when he reached them, the armies
were drawn up, the Philistines on one mountain,
and the Israelites on the other, with the
ravine between. And as David reached the
place, he saw Goliath, coming forth to challenge
the army of Israel, as he had done for
forty days.</p>

<p>And when David heard Goliath’s words, and
saw that all the army of Israel was dismayed,
he was filled with indignation, and he asked,
“Who is this Philistine, that he should defy
the armies of the living God?”</p>

<p>And David’s words were repeated to Saul,
and Saul sent for David, and David told Saul
that he would go forth and fight with Goliath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>Then said Saul, “But thou art but a youth,
and this is a man of war.”</p>

<p>Then David answered, “I have slain with
my hands both a lion and a bear, when they
came to destroy a lamb of my flock. And I
can also slay this Philistine, for Jehovah, who
delivered me out of the paw of the lion and
of the bear, will deliver me out of the hand
of this Philistine.”</p>

<p>And Saul said to David, “Go, and Jehovah
be with thee.” And he would have put his
armor upon David, but David refused it, and
taking his staff in his hand, he chose five
smooth stones out of the brook and put them
in the pocket of the shepherd’s bag which he
wore. Then with his sling in his hand, he
advanced to meet Goliath.</p>

<p>But when Goliath saw David, he exclaimed,
“Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with
a staff? Come on, then, and I will give thy
flesh to the fowls of the heavens and to the
beasts of the field.”</p>

<p>And David answered, “Thou comest to me
with a sword and with a spear, but I come to
thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God
of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
This day will Jehovah deliver thee into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
my hand, and all the earth shall know that
Israel has a God.”</p>

<p>And David put his hand into his bag and
drew forth a stone and put it into his sling
and he slung it; and it struck the Philistine
in the forehead, and he fell on his face to the
earth.</p>

<p>And the army of Israel arose and shouted,
and the Philistines became the servants of
Israel, and great honors were heaped upon
David.</p>

<p>Some years after this, at the death of Saul,
David became king of Israel, but he never
forgot his days upon the hills of Bethlehem,
when he tended his father’s sheep; and he
was called the “Shepherd King.”</p>

<p>After he had become king, David wrote
many beautiful songs or psalms, and one of
the most beautiful of them all is the twenty-third
psalm, which shows that even when all
the glory and honor of being a king were his,
he loved to think of himself as one of the
sheep over whom the Lord watched as a
shepherd.</p>

<h4>The Twenty-third Psalm</h4>

<p>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.</p>

<p>He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
he leadeth me beside the still waters.</p>

<p>He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the
paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.</p>

<p>Yea, though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for
thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they
comfort me.</p>

<p>Thou preparest a table before me in the
presence of mine enemies: thou anointest
my head with oil; my cup runneth over.</p>

<p>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life: and I will dwell in
the house of the Lord for ever.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
